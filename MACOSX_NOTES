# The following is the beginning of a native MacOSX setup script.
# It is based on the notes I took while getting my local Apple M1
# working under the Monterey (12.4) version of MacOS.

# You will need to get Xcode (free download from the App Store) and
# install the command line tools with:
#
# xcode-select --install

# You will also need homebrew from https://brew.sh/:
#
# /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# If you already have homebrew install you may want to do:
# brew outdated # Reports on outdated recipes
# brew upgrade

# Install a bunch of useful stuff from Homebrew

brew install git mysql exiftool libjpeg shared-mime-info openssl imagemagick findutils

# If you haven't done so already, install a more recent version of Bash and set
# it as the default. You can find your installed version like this:
# bash --version

# Apple only includes Bash 3.2 from 2007 in all versions of Mac OS X even now,
# because Bash > 4.0 uses GPLv3, and they don't want to support that license.
# MO's scripts use syntax that requires Bash >= 4.0.
# Reference: https://medium.com/p/7138bd1066ba
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6047648/associative-arrays-error-declare-a-invalid-option
# To install the newest Bash alongside older versions:
# brew install bash

# now check paths of all versions installed
# which -a bash
# you should get something like this
# /usr/local/bin/bash
# /bin/bash
# check those versions
# /usr/local/bin/bash --version
# /bin/bash --version
# now check
# bash --version
# should be the new one.
# So far, so good. Now you have make this version the default.
# sudo vim /etc/shells
# (add at the bottom of the list: /usr/local/bin/bash and save out)
# Set the default shell:
# chsh -s /usr/local/bin/bash
# Set the default shell for the root user:
# sudo chsh -s /usr/local/bin/bash

# Configure MySQL
brew services start mysql
mysqladmin -u root password 'root'

# Make sure you have an update to checkout of this repo in a local directory.
# Since you're reading this you may have already done that.
# In case you haven't run:

# git clone git@github.com:MushroomObserver/mushroom-observer.git
# cd mushroom-observer

# Make sure you have the current version of Ruby.
if ! [[ `ruby --version` =~ `cat .ruby-version` ]]; then
    echo You need to install version `cat .ruby-version` of ruby
fi

# There are various tools for this (rvm, chruby, rbenv).
# MO has generally used rvm, but I used chruby most recently
# because it was already installed.
# For chruby you need to run:
#    ruby-build $RUBY_VERSION ~/.rubies/ruby-$RUBY_VERSION
#    chruby $RUBY_VERSION
# Then open a new shell
