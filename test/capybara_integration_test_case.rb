#  = Capybara Integration Test Case
#
#  The test case class that all Capybara integration tests currently derive
#  from. Includes:
#
#    class YourTest < IntegrationTestCase
#
#      # Most basic test doesn't even need to know about session: all session
#      # methods are automatically delegated to a default session created at
#      # setup.
#      def test_simplest
#        visit('/controller/action?args=...')
#        click_button('Post Comment')
#        fill_in('message', 'This is a test.')
#        click_button('Post')
#      end
#
#      # More complicated session management, with CapybaraIntegrationExtensions
#      def test_multiple_session
#
#        # Create two sessions: think "browser" - each session represents the
#        # actions of a single user in one or more tabs of a single browser.
#        rolf_session = Capybara::Session.new(:rack_test, Rails.application)
#        using_session(rolf_session) { login_user('rolf') }
#        mary_session = Capybara::Session.new(:rack_test, Rails.application)
#        using_session(mary_session) { login_user('mary') }
#
#        # Have Rolf do some stuff.
#        using_session(rolf) { visit('/edit_rolfs_stuff') }
#
#        # Have Mary do stuff.
#        using_session(mary) { visit('/edit_rolfs_stuff') }
#        mary.assert_redirect
#
#        # You can also create anonymous sessions.
#        session = Capybara::Session.new(:rack_test, Rails.application)
#        session.visit('/show_index')
#        session.assert_selector('span', :text => 'Rolfs Thing', :count => 0)
