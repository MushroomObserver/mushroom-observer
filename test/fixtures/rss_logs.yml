# These fixtures use Advanced Features, including autogenerated IDs and label
# references for associations. Some associations for this fixture may be defined
# in a fixture on the opposite side of the association.
# See http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/FixtureSet.html

# All logged Observations should have at least one Image in case an integration
# test clicks on the image.

# Some integration tests expect this to be at the top of the RSS Log.
# Therefore insure that other Observation entries have earlier updated_at's.
