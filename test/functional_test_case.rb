#  = Functional Test Case
#
#  The test case class that all functional tests currently derive from.
#  Includes:
#
#  1. Some general-purpose helpers and assertions from GeneralExtensions.
#  2. Some controller-related helpers and assertions from ControllerExtensions.
#  3. A few helpers that encapsulate testing the flash error mechanism.
