#  = Integration Test Case
#
#  The test case class that all integration tests currently derive from.
#  Includes:
#
#    class YourTest < IntegrationTestCase
#
#      # Most basic test doesn't even need to know about session: all session methods
#      # are automatically delegated to a default session created at setup.
#      def test_simplest
#        get('/controller/action?args=...')
#        assert_template('controller/action')
#        click(:label => 'Post Comment')
#        open_form do |form|
#          form.edit_field('message', 'This is a test.')
#          form.submit('Post')
#        end
#      end
#
#      # More complicated session management.
#      def test_multiple_session
#
#        # Create two sessions: think "browser" - each session represents the
#        # actions of a single user in one or more tabs of a single browser.
#        rolf = login!('rolf')
#        mary = login!('mary')
#
#        # Have Rolf do some stuff.
#        rolf.get('/edit_rolfs_stuff')
#        rolf.assert_success
#
#        # Have Mary do stuff.
#        mary.get('/edit_rolfs_stuff')
#        mary.assert_redirect
#
#        # You can also create anonymous sessions.
#        open_session do
#          get('/show_index')
#          assert_select('span', :text => 'Rolfs Thing', :count => 0)
#        end
#      end
