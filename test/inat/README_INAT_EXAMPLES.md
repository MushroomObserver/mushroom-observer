# iNat Examples

This file

- Describes files used to stub requests to the iNat API and otherwise substitute for iNat API responses;
- Lists additional examples needed for better testing.

## Observations

Strings comprising the body of a response to an [iNat API Observation Search](https://api.inaturalist.org/v1/docs/#!/Observations/get_observations),
unless otherwise noted.
The files do not contain conidential data, except as otherwise noted.
The file is in json format. It includes the complete search result, which includes `results`, which include the `observation`(s).

All data as of the time of importing. (The corresponding iNat Observation may have changed)

## TODO

### Needed Observation Examples

iNat fungal Obss with these fields/licenses

- Notes
- Observation Fields
  - sequence (need a variety of these; there are many ways to add sequences to iNat Obss)
  - sensu lato
  - various dna fields (DNA Barcode ITS, Collector, Collection Number)
- Activity
- Annotations
- Public Domain
<https://api.inaturalist.org/v1/observations?identified=true&license=cc0&rank=species&iconic_taxa=Fungi&quality_grade=research&page=1&order=desc&order_by=created_at&only_id=true>
- nonderiv license
- Fungus with photo that was uploaded to iNat >= 1 day after iNat Obs was created
- Obs with narrower Photo license than overall Obs License.
