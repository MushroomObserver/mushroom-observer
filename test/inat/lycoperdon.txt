might be L. umbrinum after all. Jeppson described L. subumbrinum because he had a bunch of sequences that were very different than his sequences of L. umbrinum (not even in the same part of the tree). But his sequences of L. umbrinum were mislabeled! They were actually 'Gastropila' fumosa. I have no idea how that mistake was made. He acknowledged that the only difference he could find was coarser ornamentation on the spores of L. subumbrinum than in L. umbrinum. Since spore ornamentations measure in tenths of a micron, to be coarser, we're talking a difference of only some hundreths of a micron! That's no basis to describe a new species. His sequences of the type collections of L. subumbrinum are indeed about 4 bp different than actual sequences of L. umbrinum, but that species seems to have some genetic variation as EU sequences of that species differ amongst themselves by the same amount. And our local sequences differ by the same amount from sequences of both species. I bet it's all one species, and that we have L. umbrinum here in the PNW, and that L. subumbrinum is not a distinct species.\n","category":"leading","current":true,"flags":[],"own_observation":true,"taxon_change":null,"vision":false,"disagreement":true,"previous_observation_taxon_id":1040241,"spam":false,"taxon_id":118139,"hidden":false,"moderator_actions":[],"taxon":{"id":118139,"rank":"species","rank_level":10,"iconic_taxon_id":47170,"ancestor_ids":[48460,47170,47169,492000,50814,1094814,47167,785517,48445,48444],"is_active":true,"min_species_taxon_id":118139,"name":"Lycoperdon
