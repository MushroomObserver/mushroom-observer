New Relics Diagnostics

New Relic Diagnostics is a utility that automatically detects common problems 
with New Relic agents. If Diagnostics detects a problem, it suggests 
troubleshooting steps to resolve the problem. New Relic Diagnostics can also 
automatically attach troubleshooting data to a New Relic Support ticket if 
your subscription includes access.

New Relic Diagnostics is a standalone executable. It is designed to be run from the root of your project and search for any relevant config and log files. By default New Relic Diagnostics will transmit certain limited usage data such as details on diagnostic tasks and New Relic account and application ID numbers and New Relic license keys.
