# Phlex Form Conversions

Before writing ANY Phlex form component, you MUST:

1. Read `.claude/phlex_style_guide.md` in full
2. Read `app/components/application_form.rb` to understand available field
   helpers and the base class API
3. Read an existing form component as a reference (e.g.
   `app/components/herbarium_form.rb`, `app/components/name_form.rb`)

Do NOT skip these reads even if the conversion seems straightforward.

After writing the component:

4. Write a component test in `test/components/` following the patterns in
   `.claude/rules/testing.md` (consolidate assertions per render, extract
   a DRY render helper, etc.). See `test/components/herbarium_form_test.rb`
   or `test/components/sequence_form_test.rb` for reference.
