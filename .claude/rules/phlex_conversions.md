# Phlex Conversions

## The scope is the ERB **and** its helpers — every time

Every Phlex conversion PR has two halves, and both are in scope. The
loud half is the ERB file you're replacing. The quiet half is the
helper code that ERB calls — `app/helpers/<thing>_helper.rb` methods,
private partial-builders, hash/array-shape "data" methods, anything
the ERB pulls in to render itself. **Inline every helper you can on
the same PR.**

Why this is non-negotiable:

- The point of moving to Phlex is to put *all* of a page's rendering
  logic in one Ruby class — methods, conditionals, helpers, the lot.
  If you leave the helper behind, you've moved the markup but
  scattered the logic across two files. Reviewers and future readers
  still have to chase the same render across the same two places.
- ERB-era helpers were the workaround for ERB being a bad place to
  write Ruby. In a Phlex view, you have private methods, normal
  control flow, and `register_*_helper` for the cases where you
  really do need the Rails helper context. Most helpers stop earning
  their keep the moment the view becomes Phlex.
- Helpers accumulate quietly. A "just the markup" conversion that
  defers the helper to a later PR almost always leaves the helper
  there permanently — there's no natural next trigger to come back
  to it. Touch it now, finish it.

Apply the move-vs-register heuristic in "Moving a helper into a Phlex
view" below to every helper the ERB calls:

- Self-contained body (`:symbol.t` lookups, model attribute reads,
  plain Ruby, calls only to itself) → **inline as a private method
  on the new Phlex view** (or extract a sibling Phlex class if the
  helper is doing something a class deserves to own — e.g. row
  construction for a table → an `Aliases::Table` view).
- Body composes other helpers (tab builders, etc.) → leave registered
  for now (`register_value_helper`), with a comment.

By the end of the PR, the helper file should be measurably smaller —
ideally empty and deleted. PR descriptions should call out the
helper-side cleanup explicitly so reviewers can see both halves of
the work. If you find yourself opening a follow-up PR purely to
inline helpers from a conversion you just shipped, the conversion
was incomplete.

## Decide first: reusable or single-use?

The first decision when converting an ERB helper / partial / template to
Phlex is **where the new Phlex class lives**. Make this decision before
writing any code — it determines the namespace, the file path, the test
location, and how reviewers reason about reuse.

**Default placement when converting an ERB view to Phlex.** ERB files
living under `app/views/` get converted to Phlex classes under
`app/views/controllers/<controller>/<name>.rb`. This applies to
*everything* in the views tree — forms, tables, panels, sidebars, navs,
modals, headers, page wrappers, footers, list rows, partials of any
kind. The default is the views tree, not `app/components/`.

**Exception: true UI primitives.** If while converting you extract a
chunk that's a genuine, reusable UI building block — a button group, a
badge, an alert, a generic widget that you'd recognize as a
"component" regardless of where it happens to be rendered today —
that piece can live in `app/components/` even if only one caller
currently exists. The "speculated future caller" carve-out applies
*only* to recognizably-generic UI primitives. It does NOT apply to
page-specific fragments wearing component clothing (e.g. a
`Components::WhateverShowDetails` that only ever renders one
controller's show page — that's a view, put it in
`app/views/controllers/`).

Heuristic: would a reader who doesn't know this codebase look at the
class name and the file's contents and say "yes, that's a component"?
If yes, `app/components/`. If they'd say "that's the
`whatever_controller`'s `show` page", `app/views/controllers/`.

- **Single-use view file (default for ERB conversions)** →
  `app/views/controllers/<controller>/<name>.rb`, class
  `Views::Controllers::<Controller>::<Name>` (deep namespace mirroring
  the controller tree), tests in `test/views/controllers/...`. Use this
  when the class only renders for one controller's pages, including
  the case where the only "second caller" is a turbo_stream response
  in that same controller.

- **Reusable component (UI primitives or genuinely multi-caller)** →
  `app/components/<name>.rb`, class `Components::<Name>` (flat
  namespace), tests in `test/components/`. Use this for true UI
  building blocks (button groups, badges, alerts, etc.) regardless of
  current caller count, OR for non-primitive classes that already have
  a concrete second caller.

Both inherit from `Phlex::HTML` via `Components::Base` (`Views::Base` is
a thin subclass). The split is for organization and intent, not
capability — they can do the same things.

Why this matters:

- **`app/views/` stays organized like the ERB tree it replaces.** A
  Phlex single-use view sits next to the action templates it serves —
  the same place a partial used to live. Reviewers find it where they
  expect.
- **`app/components/` stays small and meaningful.** It contains real
  building blocks, not page-specific fragments. Putting a page-specific
  fragment there implies "reuse me elsewhere" — an invitation that
  rarely turns out well.
- **Eventually action templates themselves migrate to Phlex.** When
  `index.html.erb` becomes `index.rb`, it joins the same
  `app/views/controllers/<controller>/` directory as the partial-
  equivalents already there. The structure scales.

If a single-use class becomes reusable later, move it: rename file,
flatten namespace, update callers. Cheap refactor. Don't speculatively
put a single-use class in `app/components/` "just in case."

Example of the single-use pattern: see
`app/views/controllers/account/api_keys/table.rb`
(`Views::Controllers::Account::APIKeys::Table`) — the api_keys index
table chunk, rendered by both the index page and the post-CUD
turbo_stream response, both within the api_keys controller.

## Collapse deep namespaces in `Views::Controllers::*`

The `Views::Controllers::<Controller>::<Name>` namespace is four levels
deep for most controllers (deeper for nested controllers like
`Account::APIKeys`). **Do not** indent four times. Open the whole chain
in a single declaration:

```ruby
# DO
module Views::Controllers::Account::APIKeys
  class Table < Views::Base
    def view_template
      # ...
    end
  end
end

# DON'T
module Views
  module Controllers
    module Account
      module APIKeys
        class Table < Views::Base
          def view_template
            # ...                  # body buried at 10 spaces
          end
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

This works because the parent namespaces (`Views`, `Views::Controllers`,
etc.) are already autoloadable — Zeitwerk discovers them from the
directory structure once `app/views/` is registered with
`namespace: Views` in `config/initializers/phlex.rb`. Ruby will resolve
the chain when it evaluates the `module` line.

Apply the same shorthand in tests:

```ruby
module Views::Controllers::Account::APIKeys
  class TableTest < ComponentTestCase
    # ...
  end
end
```

Inside the namespace, sibling classes reference each other unqualified:
`render(Form.new(...))` rather than the full
`render(Views::Controllers::Account::APIKeys::Form.new(...))`.

## Helpers available everywhere — no per-class registration

A handful of helper sources are wired into the Phlex base classes:

- **`Components::Base`** registers app-wide helpers: `q_param`,
  `add_q_param`, `url_for`, `permission?`, `link_to_object`,
  `user_link`, `location_link`, `link_icon`, `help_block`,
  `make_table`, etc. — see the registration block at the top of
  `app/components/base.rb` for the full list.
- **`Components::Base`** also includes `Phlex::Rails::Helpers::Routes`
  (every named route helper — `foo_path`, `bar_url`),
  `Phlex::Rails::Helpers::AssetPath` (`asset_path`),
  `Phlex::Rails::Helpers::LinkTo` (`link_to`),
  `Phlex::Rails::Helpers::ButtonTo` (`button_to`),
  `Phlex::Rails::Helpers::ClassNames` (`class_names`), and
  `Phlex::Rails::Helpers::TurboFrameTag` (`turbo_frame_tag`).
- **`Views::Base`** layers on the page-chrome helpers:
  `add_page_title`, `add_new_title`, `add_edit_title`,
  `add_context_nav`, `add_project_banner`, `container_class`,
  `content_for`.
- **`Views::Base`** also includes every top-level `Tabs::*Helper`
  module via a `to_prepare` hook in `config/initializers/phlex.rb`.
  Any tab builder (`object_return_tab(...)`,
  `species_lists_index_tabs(...)`, `inat_import_form_new_tabs(...)`,
  etc.) is callable from any view as if it were a class method.
  Nested modules under `Tabs::Sidebar::*`, `Tabs::Locations::*`,
  `Tabs::Names::*` are NOT auto-included — they stay scoped to
  their specific callers.

**Don't `register_value_helper`** for anything in those buckets.
The registration is a no-op duplicate.

If your view needs a helper that isn't in any of those buckets, it
falls into the move-vs-register decision below.

## Moving a helper into a Phlex view

When converting an action template to Phlex, you'll often find page
logic spread between the ERB and `app/helpers/...` modules. The
helpers either need to move into the Phlex view class (cleaner) or
stay registered as helpers (looser coupling). Choosing wrong leads
to nasty failures, so:

**Move a helper method into the Phlex view when** its body is
self-contained — symbol/translation lookups, model attribute reads,
plain Ruby. No calls to *other* helper methods.

Example — `checklist_show_title` (used by
`Views::Controllers::Checklists::Show`) is pure `:foo.t` lookups.
Moves cleanly as a private method on the view class.

```ruby
# Before — in app/helpers/tabs/checklists_helper.rb
def checklist_show_title(user:, list:)
  if user      then :checklist_for_user_title.t(user: user.legal_name)
  elsif list   then :checklist_for_species_list_title.t(list: list.title)
  else              :checklist_for_site_title.t
  end
end

# After — inline in Views::Controllers::Checklists::Show
private def checklist_show_title
  user, list = @context.show_user, @context.species_list
  if user      then :checklist_for_user_title.t(user: user.legal_name)
  elsif list   then :checklist_for_species_list_title.t(list: list.title)
  else              :checklist_for_site_title.t
  end
end
```

**Keep it registered (do NOT move) when** the body calls other
helper methods — e.g. tab builders that compose
`user_profile_tab`, `show_object_tab`, `email_user_question_tab`,
etc. across multiple `Tabs::*Helper` modules.

```ruby
# Stays in app/helpers/tabs/checklists_helper.rb — calls helpers
# in Users / Info / SpeciesLists / etc. modules
def checklist_show_tabs(user:, list:)
  if user    then checklist_for_user_tabs(user)
  ...
end

# In the Phlex view class:
register_value_helper :checklist_show_tabs
```

**Why "moving multi-helper methods" doesn't work yet.** Inside a
Phlex view, `helpers.foo(...)` only resolves to *registered*
helpers; everything else surfaces as
`NoMethodError: private method 'foo' called for an instance of ...`.
So if you move `checklist_show_tabs` into the view but its body
still calls `user_profile_tab(user)` etc., you'd have to:

- register each transitively-used helper (cascading; one move
  drags in 5–10 registrations), or
- `include Tabs::UsersHelper`, `include Tabs::InfoHelper`, … —
  multiple module includes per view to restore helper-chain
  transparency.

Neither is paying for itself today. **Eventually** we want a
mechanism that exposes the full tab-helper namespace to Phlex
views without explicit `helpers.*` or per-method registration; until
then, leave multi-helper methods registered.

Heuristic to apply during a conversion:

- Body is `:symbol.t(...)`, model attribute reads, plain Ruby? →
  **move into the view** as a private method.
- Body calls *any* method that isn't on `self` or a Ruby standard
  library? → **leave in the helper module**, `register_value_helper`
  on the view.

## Phlex Form Conversions

Before writing ANY Phlex form component, you MUST:

1. Read `.claude/phlex_style_guide.md` in full
2. Read `app/components/application_form.rb` for the base class API, then
   `app/components/application_form/field_helpers.rb` for all available
   field helpers (`text_field`, `textarea_field`, `checkbox_field`, etc.)
3. Read an existing form component as a reference (e.g.
   `app/components/herbarium_form.rb`, `app/components/name_form.rb`)

Do NOT skip these reads even if the conversion seems straightforward.

While writing the component, for **every** form control you add, follow the
"NEVER hand-roll form-control HTML" decision tree in `phlex_style_guide.md`:

- Field is on the model / FormObject? → `text_field(:foo)` (Symbol,
  model-bound).
- Field's `name=` belongs in the form's namespace but value comes from
  outside the model? → `text_field(:foo, value: …)` (Symbol + explicit
  `value:`).
- Field's `name=` is under a different namespace or top-level? →
  `text_field("namespace[foo]", value: …)` (String, raw `name=`).
- Outside a form? → `Components::ApplicationForm::FieldProxy.new(...) +
  render(Components::ApplicationForm::TextField.new(proxy, ...))` —
  used by feedback / editor components that don't own the `<form>` tag.
- **Never** emit raw `input`, `select`, `textarea`, or `option` tags from a
  form component. If you find yourself reaching for them, you're missing
  one of the four paths above. Re-read the FieldProxy section in
  `phlex_style_guide.md` before proceeding. (This rule was added after PR
  #4224 had to undo a hand-rolled radio group from PR #4076. The
  Symbol+`value:` and String paths landed in PRs #4382 and #4384 to make
  non-model-bound fields go through the same helpers.)

### Watch for a decorative `Model.new` passed to `super`

If your form has bound fields, pass the real model (or a real FormObject)
that actually backs them. The anti-pattern is passing a throwaway
`Foo.new` *just* to make Superform happy, then hand-rolling every input
with raw `name=` strings.

```ruby
# ❌ Anti-pattern. The Occurrence is decorative — nothing binds to it.
class Components::OccurrenceResolveForm < Components::ApplicationForm
  def initialize(gaps:, primary:, selected: nil, **)
    @gaps = gaps; @primary = primary; @selected = selected
    super(Occurrence.new, **)
  end

  def selected_hidden_fields
    # Hand-rolled because nothing binds to the model:
    @selected.each { |obs| hidden_field("occurrence[observation_ids][]", value: obs.id) }
    hidden_field("occurrence[primary_observation_id]", value: @primary.id)
  end
end

# ✅ Fix: introduce a FormObject that *actually* represents the form's data.
class FormObject::OccurrenceProjects < FormObject::Base
  attribute :resolution, :string
  attribute :primary_observation_id, :integer
  attribute :observation_ids, default: -> { [] }
end

class Components::OccurrenceProjectsForm < Components::ApplicationForm
  def initialize(gaps:, primary:, selected: nil, **)
    # ...
    super(build_form_object, **)
  end

  def selected_hidden_fields
    hidden_field(:primary_observation_id)   # Symbol path → bound + namespaced
    # ...
  end
end
```

**Why it matters:**

- Misleading: a reader sees `Occurrence.new` and thinks "this form
  edits an Occurrence." It doesn't.
- Defeats Superform: the `<form_name>[<field>]` param namespacing,
  PATCH-vs-POST method picking via `model.persisted?`, and field
  binding all stop working as designed.
- Often comes with a route mismatch: the decorative model
  silently flips `_method=patch` on or off (depending on
  `persisted?`), so the form submits to the wrong HTTP verb.

**Fuzzy cases.** It isn't always black-and-white. Real forms sometimes
sit on a gradient between "this is an `X` form" and "this is an
operation that incidentally touches `X`." Some signs you're in fuzzy
territory:

- Most fields bind to the model, but one or two are operation-specific
  (e.g. a `confirm_email` checkbox on an Account edit form). Stay on
  the real model and let those one-offs ride along — they don't
  justify a FormObject.
- The form's params end up shaped exactly like `<model_name>[...]`
  by design, even though the data is operation state. Then the model
  *is* a fair stand-in for what the controller will read; passing it
  isn't decorative.
- The model is real but most fields don't bind to it directly — the
  form is mostly hidden re-submissions of selection state plus a
  resolution choice. That's the case where a FormObject is the right
  fix (e.g. `FormObject::OccurrenceProjects`).

If the decision isn't obvious, ask: *would a future reader, looking at
the constructor's first argument, infer what the form does?* If not,
the model is decorative — refactor.

(Rule added after the `OccurrenceResolveForm` → `OccurrenceProjectsForm`
refactor in #4345.)

After writing the component:

4. Write a component test in `test/components/` following the patterns in
   `.claude/rules/testing.md` (consolidate assertions per render, extract
   a DRY render helper, etc.). See `test/components/herbarium_form_test.rb`
   or `test/components/sequence_form_test.rb` for reference.
5. Self-review the component diff for any literal `input(`, `select(`,
   `textarea(`, or `option(` calls. If present, replace each with the
   helper or FieldProxy pattern before opening the PR.
6. **If the component replaces an ERB modal or form, run an HTML-parity
   diff against the pre-refactor markup before opening the PR.** Use the
   diff harness pattern from `.claude/rules/testing.md`
   ("Debugging Phlex Component Conversions / The HTML Diff Technique"):
   keep a renamed `_Old` copy of the original component on the branch,
   write a one-off test that renders both with identical inputs and
   writes them to `/tmp/foo_old.html` + `/tmp/foo_new.html`, then `diff`
   the formatted output.

   For every difference, decide:
   - **Preserve** it via `wrapper_options: { wrap_class: ... }` on
     collection fields, `wrap_class:` on field helpers, explicit Phlex
     `class:` attrs, or whatever knob the new component exposes. Common
     drops to look for: `.mb-2` on `.radio` / `.checkbox` rows,
     `text-right`/`mt-3` on button rows, custom `data-*` attributes,
     ARIA labels, the modal's `.modal-header` vs. `.modal-body` /
     `.modal-footer` placement of submit buttons. See
     `phlex_style_guide.md` — `Form Inside a Modal` for the modal-form
     case specifically.
   - **Call it out** explicitly in the PR description if you're
     intentionally changing the markup (e.g. adding `.fade` for animation
     consistency, dropping an unused id). Reviewers shouldn't have to
     spot drift in a diff that calls itself "no functional change".

   This is mandatory for modal/form ERB→Phlex conversions — the visual
   contract there is easy to drift on, and reviewers can't catch it
   without the diff (controller / component tests are happy with either
   markup). For non-form, non-modal components the diff is still a good
   habit but isn't required.
