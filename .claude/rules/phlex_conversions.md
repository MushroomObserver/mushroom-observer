# Phlex Form Conversions

Before writing ANY Phlex form component, you MUST:

1. Read `.claude/phlex_style_guide.md` in full
2. Read `app/components/application_form.rb` for the base class API, then
   `app/components/application_form/field_helpers.rb` for all available
   field helpers (`text_field`, `textarea_field`, `checkbox_field`, etc.)
3. Read an existing form component as a reference (e.g.
   `app/components/herbarium_form.rb`, `app/components/name_form.rb`)

Do NOT skip these reads even if the conversion seems straightforward.

While writing the component, for **every** form control you add, follow the
"NEVER hand-roll form-control HTML" decision tree in `phlex_style_guide.md`:

- Field is on the model / FormObject? → use the matching `*_field` helper.
- Field isn't on the model? → wrap it with
  `Components::ApplicationForm::FieldProxy` and render the matching field
  class (`RadioField`, `TextField`, `CheckboxField`, `SelectField`, …).
- **Never** emit raw `input`, `select`, `textarea`, or `option` tags from a
  form component. If you find yourself reaching for them, you're missing
  one of the two paths above. Re-read the FieldProxy section before
  proceeding. (This rule was added after PR #4224 had to undo a hand-rolled
  radio group from PR #4076.)

After writing the component:

4. Write a component test in `test/components/` following the patterns in
   `.claude/rules/testing.md` (consolidate assertions per render, extract
   a DRY render helper, etc.). See `test/components/herbarium_form_test.rb`
   or `test/components/sequence_form_test.rb` for reference.
5. Self-review the component diff for any literal `input(`, `select(`,
   `textarea(`, or `option(` calls. If present, replace each with the
   helper or FieldProxy pattern before opening the PR.
6. **If the component replaces an ERB modal or form, run an HTML-parity
   diff against the pre-refactor markup before opening the PR.** Use the
   diff harness pattern from `.claude/rules/testing.md`
   ("Debugging Phlex Component Conversions / The HTML Diff Technique"):
   keep a renamed `_Old` copy of the original component on the branch,
   write a one-off test that renders both with identical inputs and
   writes them to `/tmp/foo_old.html` + `/tmp/foo_new.html`, then `diff`
   the formatted output.

   For every difference, decide:
   - **Preserve** it via `wrapper_options: { wrap_class: ... }` on
     collection fields, `wrap_class:` on field helpers, explicit Phlex
     `class:` attrs, or whatever knob the new component exposes. Common
     drops to look for: `.mb-2` on `.radio` / `.checkbox` rows,
     `text-right`/`mt-3` on button rows, custom `data-*` attributes,
     ARIA labels, the modal's `.modal-header` vs. `.modal-body` /
     `.modal-footer` placement of submit buttons. See
     `phlex_style_guide.md` — `Form Inside a Modal` for the modal-form
     case specifically.
   - **Call it out** explicitly in the PR description if you're
     intentionally changing the markup (e.g. adding `.fade` for animation
     consistency, dropping an unused id). Reviewers shouldn't have to
     spot drift in a diff that calls itself "no functional change".

   This is mandatory for modal/form ERB→Phlex conversions — the visual
   contract there is easy to drift on, and reviewers can't catch it
   without the diff (controller / component tests are happy with either
   markup). For non-form, non-modal components the diff is still a good
   habit but isn't required.
