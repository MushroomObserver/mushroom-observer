= Clean Code

We are trying to apply what we believe are the best practices for code
development. Currently that means we like things like "agile methodology",
"clean code" and "test driven development". There is a great deal of
information out on the web about all of these terms. A good book about it
"Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship" by Robert C. Martin.
We highly recommend finding a copy of this book. It is thought-provoking,
and regardless of your philosophy, it is guaranteed to improve your
understanding and application of clean coding practices. (Note that the book
is written for Java, but it applies equally well to Ruby.)

A short summary of the key guidelines are:

1. It is better to contribute than to be intimidated by any of the following
rules.

2. Boy Scouts Rule: Leave the code cleaner than you found it.
(Corollary: don't hesitate to refactor other people's code.)

3. Only check in code that passes all the tests.

4. Do not repeat yourself.

5. Keep functions and classes small and well-named.

6. If documentation is required, try refactoring instead.

7. Write tests for every bug you fix and every feature you add.

8. Test Driven Development is encouraged, but not required.

We are always happy to discuss the topic. The present code is in need of a
great deal of work, however there are a few examples I think we can all
agree exemplify where we're trying to move the code:

controller::  app/controllers/sequence_controller.rb
helper::      app/helpers/map_*.rb
other::       app/classes/api/*
unit test::   test/integration/post_observation_test.rb

= MVC Architecture

MVC is all about separating data ("model"), logic ("control") and presentation
("view"). In practice I find the separation is between each pair is fuzzy.
But the principle is well worth keeping in mind during code design. Here are
a few simple rules of thumb:

1. The view templates should not query or modify the database.

2. The controller should not know whether the view is writing HTML, XML, or JSON.

3. The models should not be able to distinguish whether the caller is a
web server, the API, or a rake task.

4. Views and controllers should be unaware whether the data is stored in a
SQL relational database or an Excel spreadsheet.

For more infomration see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller.
See also the section entitled *Transactions* below.

= Progressive Enhancement

We have used "Progressive Enhancement" as opposed to "Graceful
Degradation". This means that user interface should be designed initially
with a minimal, text-only browser, without any javascript. Then you can
start adding javascript, dynamic HTML and AJAX progressively to this basic
page. All features should be available to browsers without javascript.

= Tests

We are serious about this. Every minute "wasted" writing and cleaning up
unit tests pays for itself tenfold later. No code is complete until
 it has a full suite of unit tests verifying its behavior thoroughly.

A full test suite is critical to Agile software development, because it
gives programmers the confidence to refactor code liberally without worrying
about crashing the website. If your modifications pass all of our tests,
you can rest assured that you haven't broken anything.

A related guideline is to force yourself to write a test for every bug you
find. Write the test first, ensure that it actually fails, *then* fix it.

= Comments

Clean Code claims that good code requires no comments. If a variable requires
comments, then it is named poorly. If a method requires comments, then it is
too complex and should be broken up. Extensive comments are virtually
guaranteed to end up out of date and more harmful than helpful. However, I
personally (Jason) think complex classes benefit from overviews. We're still
working out the appropriate level of compromise.

Ruby provides a mechanism for extracting and compiling comments into a set of
handy HTML documentation for your application (<tt>rake rdoc</tt>). If you do
write comments for a class or method, it is worth ensuring that +rdoc+ can
parse it correctly. Place comments in the lines just above the applicable
+class+ or +def+ keyword.

We've just started to implement a set of comment directives in the controllers
to help us manage access to actions (+:nologin:+, +:norobots:+, +:prefetch:+,
+:root:+). Eventually we will write a +rake+ task that reads these and ensures
that the +requires_login+ and +requires_root+ filters are implemented
correctly; that +robots.txt+ is complete; and that no dangerous methods allow
prefetching.

= Optimization

Rails makes it very easy to write queries that bring the server grinding to a
halt. The practice we recommend is to write your code initially with clarity
and readability foremost in mind. Then do benchmark tests and start
considering optimizations once you can demonstrate objectively whether they
actually help.

The class Query has proven to be extremely effective in separating out
optimization from data requirements. It encourages controllers to structure
themselves in terms of queries which return a set of a single type of object.
Related data can then be eager-loaded efficiently using the <tt>:include =>
:associations</tt> mechanism. The query itself can then be optimized safely in
isolation from the control code, with access to the full capabilities of MySQL
(not always available via ActiveRecord). Results of such Query's can then
automatically be handled by index/prev/next, modified and refined, and passed
between actions just like any other query.

= Transactions

We have half-implemented a mechanism by which multiple instances of MO may
collaborate. It involves creating a way to describe and store all fundamental
database operations (Transaction), as well as a way to reproduce those
operations on other servers (API). This has implications about how controllers
and models are developed. It encourages simplifying operations as much as
possible, and moving as much of the mechanics of the operations into the model,
which API has access to, instead of the controller, which API doesn't have
access to.

For example, user creates an observation: It is okay to validate the species
name in the controller, because that requires communication and feedback from
the user. But if creating the observation requires logging, notifications,
updating user contribution score, votes, etc. then all that should be moved
into an appropriate method in Observation. Otherwise we will have to duplicate
all that code again in the API.

= Text / Strings

RedCloth is a simple mark-up system. It is used extensively throughout the
site, e.g. in user-supplied notes, in scientific names, and in
"internationalization" strings (see below). For more information see RedCloth
plug-in and Textile class in <tt>app/classes/textile.rb</tt>.

All user-supplied text should be watched carefully. We used to use the Rails
helper +sanitize+ and +html_escape+, however nowadays all user-supplied text
gets processed by RedCloth instead.

All text on the site, including error messages -- anything that the end user
will see -- is kept in a set of YAML files in <tt>config/locales/xxx.yml</tt>.
For more information, see the documentation for Symbol#localize in
app/extensions/symbol_extensions.rb. See also README_TRANSLATIONS.

= Continuous Integration

We use GitHub Actions and Codeclimate for continuous integration.
They run on pushes or PRs to our GitHub repository.
- The GitHub Actions workflow runs:
  - our Minitest test suite,
  - creates a coverage file and submits it to Coveralls.
- Coveralls then uses that file to report code coverage details.
- Codeclimate uses RuboCop, Brakeman, and other linters
  to provide style and code quality information and metrics.
  Codeclimate runs independently of, and in parallel to, Github Actions.

Developers should
- fix any test errors and failures,
- fix any new Codeclimate issues,
- fix any test coverage decreases.
