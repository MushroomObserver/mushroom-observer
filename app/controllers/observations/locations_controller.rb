    #  :section: Associate Observations with "undefined" +where+ strings
    #            to Location db records as a batch.
    #
    ############################################################################

    # NOTE: This "form" is only accessed from one index flavor,
    #       "OBSERVATIONS AT WHERE"
    #
    # It's a UI for Observations lacking a Location association in the db,
    # that share a particular "where" string. Multiple obs may share such a
    # "where" string. These are referred to as "undefined Locations" in the
    # code, but they're not really Locations at all, they're just strings that
    # have been entered by a User when creating an obs, that might help us find
    # a defined Location. Future Obs validations could force users to use known
    # locations, or to define a Location record before the obs, but we
    # currently allow this type of vagueness.
    #
    # What the list shows is a list of defined Locations that match the given
    # +where+ string, in order of closeness of match, in the following order:
    #   1) matches = match the string
    #   2) others that include everything in "where" up to the comma
    #   3) others that include the first word in "where"
    #   4) others that include the last word of the first segment in "where"
    #      (for example, "Estado de Guerrero, MÃ©xico": searches for "Guerrero")
    #   5) doesn't try other segments, because the second one could be a country
    #
    # The form is not really a `form`, but the buttons do commit to "update".
    # It contains links to assign the observations sharing the +where+ string
    # to the given Location (AR record)

    def edit
      store_location
      # NOTE: Do not use or pass Location.user_format for @where.
      # This is the string we're looking for in the db, in the `name` column,
      # and we're also assuming "postal" order when splitting the string.
      @where = params[:where].to_s
      @matches = Location.name_includes(@where)
      @others = []

      # Try for segments: split by comma, or by space if no commas
