  # Prepare the query params, adding the model, for saving to the db. The
  # :description column is accessed not just to recompose a query, but to
  # identify existing query records that match current params. That's why the
  # keys are sorted here before being stored as strings in to_json - because
  # when matching a serialized hash, strings must match exactly. This is
  # more efficient however than using a Rails-serialized column and comparing
  # the parsed hashes (in whatever order), because when a column is serialized
  # you can't use SQL on the column value, you have to compare parsed instances.
