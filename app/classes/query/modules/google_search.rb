# Helper methods for turning Query parameters into SQL conditions.
module Query::Modules::GoogleSearch
  # Give search string for notes google-like syntax:
  #   word1 word2     -->  any has both word1 and word2
  #   word1 OR word2  -->  any has either word1 or word2
  #   "word1 word2"   -->  any has word1 followed immediately by word2
  #   -word1          -->  none has word1
  #
  # Note, to conform to google, "OR" must be greedy, thus:
  #   word1 word2 OR word3 word4
  # is interpreted as:
  #   any has (word1 and (either word2 or word3) and word4)
  #
  # Note, the following are not allowed:
  #   -word1 OR word2
  #   -word1 OR -word2
  #
  # The result is an Array of positive asserions and an Array of negative
  # assertions.  Each positive assertion is one or more strings.  One of the
  # fields being searched must contain at least one of these strings out of
  # each assertion.  (Different fields may be used for different assertions.)
  # Each negative assertion is a single string.  None of the fields being
  # searched may contain any of the negative assertions.
