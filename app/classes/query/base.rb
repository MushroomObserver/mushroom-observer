#  CREATING A NEW QUERY SUBCLASS
#
#  To make an ActiveRecord model queryable, create a new class that inherits
#  from this class, Query::Base.
#
#  ## Overview
#  Query is basically just a way to validate, sanitize, store and retrieve
#  parameters. When you execute the Query (i.e., call the `results` method),
#  each parameter of the Query instance gets sent to an ActiveRecord scope of
#  the corresponding ActiveRecord model, e.g. `Observation`. So Query instance
#  parameters obviously are specific to the AR model being queried.
#
#  For the sake of familiarity, Query classes use ActiveModel. Each instance
#  of a Query class is just a data object with validatable attributes, instance
#  methods and class methods. For Query classes, the methods are all pretty
#  standard; they are defined either here in Query::Base or in one of its
#  included Query::Modules.
#
#  The main difference from ActiveRecord objects (that also use ActiveModel) is
#  attribute validation. ActiveRecord attributes must have data types that can
#  be validated and stored in a database. _ActiveModel_ attributes are "ad hoc"
#  and temporary, and because they don't need to be stored in a database they
#  can have any data type. They only need to "work" for the use case â€” a form,
#  a query, etc. But they can call the same `validate` methods as AR models.
#
#  In our case, the parameter values need to be valid for use in corresponding
#  ActiveRecord scopes in each model. The scopes are what actually execute the
#  database query.
#
#  Each Query class declares the parameters it will accept, and what type of
#  data each parameter expects, in `parameter_declarations` at the top of the
#  class. These are the `attributes` you'd initialize a new Query instance with.
#
#    Query::Observations.new(           or     Query.new(:Observation,
#      has_public_lat_lng: true,                 has_public_lat_lng: true,
#      region: "Massachusetts, USA",             region: "Massachusetts, USA",
#      names: { lookup: "Amanita" }              names: { lookup: "Amanita" }
#    )                                         )
#
#  Potential gotcha: Most Observation query attributes, like
#  `has_public_lat_lng`, are declared in Query::Observations. However, for
#  certain params like `region`, they are declared in Query::Filter.
#  These are handled differently because default values for these params
#  may be automatically passed in according to the current user's preferences,
#  via ApplicationController::Indexes.
#
#  ## Parameter declarations
#
#  Query parameter names must map to AR scope names 1:1 (with few exceptions).
#  So the first task is to write a scope for the model that does what you want.
#
#  For example, in the query above, the parameter `has_public_lat_lng` is also
#  a scope of our Observation model that accepts a Boolean value. `region` is
#  a scope of Observation that accepts a string, and `names` accepts a hash of
#  arguments, with `lookup` being required. All of these requirements are
#  ultimately defined in the scope.
#
#  So, since the scopes can only accept certain types of data, Query needs to
#  validate (and sometimes "clean") the attributes sent to the Query instance.
#
#  We use a special syntax to declare the data type of each Query parameter or
#  attribute. The syntax is important because it tells our validation method in
#  Query::Modules::Validation, `clean_and_validate_params`, how to parse the
#  attribute value.
#
#  ### SIMPLE
#  The simplest data types are pretty self explanatory:
#
#    :string
#    :float
#    :date
#    :time
#    :boolean
#
#  Note that with some parameters, a `:string` may be a "Google-search" syntax
#  of search directives like 'Amanita -muscaria "odd coloring"', but Query
#  doesn't handle any parsing of the string. It simply forwards the string to
#  the scope of the same name. The parsing is all done by the scope.
#
#  ### MODEL
#  An attribute declared with an ActiveRecord class name means that the
#  parameter will accept either an `id` or an ActiveRecord model instance.
#  If the caller sends an instance, it will be "sanitized" to an `id`, and
#  the Query instance will only save the `id`.
#
#    User
#    Location
#    Project
#
#  ### ARRAY
#  An attribute declared with an array means that the parameter will either
#  accept one value, or an array of values. Single values do not need to be
#  sent "inside arrays".
#
#    [:string]
#    [:float]
#    [:time]
#    [User]
#    [Location]
#
#  ### HASH
#  An attribute declared with a hash could mean several things, so syntax is
#  important.
#
#  If the first key in the hash is `:string` or `:boolean`, the parameter
#  value will be parsed like an `enum`. The declaration states the allowable
#  values, and others are ignored.
#
#    { string: [:no, :either, :only] }
#    { boolean: [true] }               # simply a way of saying "ignore false"
#
#  If the first key in the hash is `:subquery`, it's parsed as a subquery of
#  the specified model. That means any enclosed params will be sent to a new
#  Query instance of that model, and merged into the current query.
#  For more on this, see Query::Modules::Subqueries.
#
#    { subquery: :Observation }
#
#  If neither `:string`, `:boolean`, nor `:subquery` is the first key, the hash
#  is parsed as a hash of arguments to be sent to the scope of the same name.
#  Each argument is independently validated as declared.
#
#  For example, this is the declaration of the attribute `in_box`:
#
#  in_box: { north: :float, south: :float, east: :float, west: :float }
