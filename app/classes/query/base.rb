#  CREATING A NEW QUERY SUBCLASS
#
#  To make an ActiveRecord model queryable, create a new class that inherits
#  from this class, Query::Base.
#
#  ## OVERVIEW
#
#  Query is basically just a way to validate, sanitize, store and retrieve
#  parameters that filter a database query of a given model, like `Name` or
#  `Observation`. A Query instance contains as little data as possible; it does
#  not contain AR records. When you execute the Query by calling the `results`
#  or `result_ids` methods, each non-nil attribute of the Query instance gets
#  sent to an ActiveRecord scope of the corresponding model; scopes are chained
#  to return the results. Query parameters must therefore each correspond to a
#  scope of the AR model.
#
#  Each Query class declares the parameters it will accept, and what type of
#  data each parameter expects, in the attributes at the top of the class.
#  You initialize a new Query instance with any combination of these.
#
#    Query::Observations.new(           or     Query.new(:Observation,
#      has_public_lat_lng: true,                 has_public_lat_lng: true,
#      region: "Massachusetts, USA",             region: "Massachusetts, USA",
#      names: { lookup: "Amanita" }              names: { lookup: "Amanita" }
#    )                                         )
#  * (see note below)
#
#  ## VALIDATION
#
#  For the sake of familiarity, Query classes use ActiveModel. Each instance of
#  a Query class is a data object with validatable attributes, instance methods
#  and class methods. The methods are mostly inherited from Query::Base, and
#  defined either here, or in one of the included Query::Modules.
#
#  The main difference from ActiveRecord objects (that also use ActiveModel) is
#  attribute validation. ActiveRecord attributes must have data types that can
#  be validated and stored in a database. _ActiveModel_ attributes are "ad hoc"
#  and temporary. Because they don't need to be stored in a database, they can
#  have any data type. They only need to "work" for the use case â€” a form, a
#  query, etc. But we can define the same `validate` methods as on AR models.
#
#  In our case, we define our own validator and data type. That data type is
#  `query_param`, and the attribute values are checked and sanitized by
#  Query::Modules::Validation on initialization. Calling `valid?` uses
#  Query::Modules::Validator to check for any validation errors that may
#  have been stored in the Query instance by `clean_and_validate_params`.
#
#  `valid?` should mean the parameter values are usable by the corresponding
#  ActiveRecord scope in each model. The scopes are what actually execute the
#  database query and define the parameter requirements.
#
#  ## PARAMETER DECLARATIONS
#
#  Query parameter names must map to AR scope names 1:1 (with few exceptions).
#  So the first task in making a class queryable is to write scopes for the
#  each attribute of the model that you want to be able to query.
#
#  For example, in the query above, the parameter `has_public_lat_lng` is also a
#  scope of our Observation model that accepts a Boolean value. It is defined
#  to find observations that have a `lat` value and where `gps_hidden` is false.
#  `region` is an Observation scope that accepts a string, and finds
#  observations within a given region. The scope `names` finds observations in
#  given taxa. `names` accepts a hash of arguments, `lookup` being required.
#  But all of these requirements and logic are ultimately defined in the scope;
#  Query is simply there to gather and store them, and pass them along.
#
#  Since the scopes can only accept certain types of data, Query needs to
#  validate (and sometimes "clean") the attributes passed to the Query instance.
#  Even though `query_param` is a single declared data type, it has a custom
#  attribute option `:accepts` that you use to pass an argument describing how
#  the attribute should be validated. (We don't differentiate between
#  `query_param` types at the attribute level because they are all validated
#  recursively, and nested values may use the same methods as top-level values.)
#
#  To keep attribute assignment from getting too verbose, we assign them using a
#  custom method `query_attr`, whose second argument is the value of `:accepts`.
#  See app/extensions/class.rb for the definition of `query_attr`. This argument
#  expects a special syntax declaring a validation type for each attribute, and
#  telling Query::Modules::Validation how to parse the attribute value.
#
#  It uses the following patterns:
#
#  ### Simple values
#
#  The simplest data types are pretty self explanatory:
#
#    :string
#    :float
#    :date
#    :time
#    :boolean
#
#  Note that with some parameters, a `:string` may be a "Google-search" syntax
#  of search directives like 'Amanita -muscaria "odd coloring"', but Query
#  doesn't do any parsing of the string. It simply forwards the string to the
#  scope of the same name. The parsing is all done by the scope.
#
#  ### Model
#
#  An attribute declared with an ActiveRecord class name means that the
#  parameter will accept either an `id` or an ActiveRecord model instance.
#  If the caller sends an instance, it will be "sanitized" to an `id`, and
#  the Query instance will only save the `id`.
#
#    User
#    Location
#    Project
#
#  ### Array
#
#  An attribute declared with an array means that the parameter will either
#  accept one value, or an array of values. Single values do not need to be
#  sent "inside arrays".
#
#    [:string]
#    [:float]
#    [:time]
#    [User]
#    [Location]
#
#  In some cases the scope may be configured to parse the array as a range of
#  values (e.g. of dates, ranks, etc.). In these scopes, passing one value
#  is valid and often considered as a minimum value. If the second value matches
#  the first, some scopes parse this as "match this value only". In all scopes
#  expecting range arrays, any values after the second are ignored.
#
#  For scopes accepting arrays of model instances like [Project], you can pass
#  any number of objects or ids, up to a limit defined in `MO.query_max_array`.
#
#  ### Hash
#
#  An attribute declared with a hash could mean several things, so syntax is
#  important.
#
#  If the first key in the hash is `:string` or `:boolean`, the parameter
#  value will be parsed like an ActiveRecord "enum". The declaration should
#  state an array of allowable values; others will be ignored.
#
#    { string: [:no, :either, :only] }
#    { boolean: [true] } # this is a way of saying "ignore false"
#
#  If the first key in the hash is `:subquery`, the attribute is parsed as a
#  subquery of the specified model.
#
#    { subquery: :Observation }
#
#  Subqueries validate enclosed params by instantiating a new Query of the
#  subquery model, sending the enclosed hash of params. For example:
#
#    Query.new(:Name, pattern: "Lactarius",
#                     observation_query: { notes_has: "Symbiota" })
#
#  The validator will call `Query.new(:Observation, notes_has: "Symbiota")`,
#  to make sure that the params are valid and the subquery will work. However,
#  during execution of the above query, the `notes_has` subparam is simply sent
#  to the Name model's scope `:observation_query`. That uses the params to call
#  scopes of the subquery (Observation) model, and merges the subquery into
#  the current Name query. For more on this, see Query::Modules::Subqueries.
#
#  If neither `:string`, `:boolean`, nor `:subquery` is the first key, the hash
#  is parsed as a hash of arguments to be sent to the scope of the same name.
#  Each argument is independently validated as declared. For example, this is
#  the declaration of the attribute `in_box`:
#
#    { north: :float, south: :float, east: :float, west: :float }
#
#  Each sub-param is validated as a :float.
