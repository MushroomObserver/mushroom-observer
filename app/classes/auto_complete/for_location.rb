# Nimmo note: Is it desirable to make `rough_matches` a scope for these models?
# Doing that, plus a method to pluck the values, would solve the ABC violation.
# Any caching advantage in that? Then below, it'd be something like:
#   Observation.rough_matches(letter).pluck_matches
# Or would this scatter the code?
# Thinking the scope could be useful for graphQL, or it could use this class.
