# By inheriting from Rubyâ€™s builtin SimpleDelegator class and calling super
# in the initialize method, we make sure that if we call any method that is
# not defined in the presenter, it passes it on to the model object.
class BasePresenter < SimpleDelegator
  def initialize(model, view, _args = {})
    @view = view
    super(model)
  end

  # h is a convention for the view context, to access helpers
  def h
