<%# locals: (form:, identifier:, title:, user:, form_locals: {}) %>

<%#
Entire template for a Bootstrap modal with a form.
Called in turbo_stream responses from `new` and `edit` form actions.
If form needs work, any flash rendered by `create` and `update` will update
`#modal_#{identifier}_flash` via turbo-stream, and re-render the form.

Requires these locals:
  identifier, used to build html ids for parts of the modal
  title, the text in the modal-header h4
  form, full path (after /views/) of the partial building the form
  user, the @user opening this form, to know if a section update should close it
  form_locals, anything else you want to send to the body partial.
     { turbo: true } gets merged so that form sends via js

In order to keep form progress if the modal is closed and opened again,
it's not destroyed when closed. Successful submit updates the page.
When page section with data-controller: section_update is updated,
that controller dispatches the updated event, and this line below:
  data-action: "section-update:updated@window->modal#remove"
calls the action `remove` in the modal controller. That controller compares
the user_id of the section_update event with the user of this modal, so
that broadcasts don't unintentionally close other peoples' modals.

Sounds circuitous, but we don't want the modal getting removed on submit,
in case there are form problems. The consequence of form success is the page
being updated. Note that all actions are called by data tags on html elements.

note: MUST REMOVE **.html**.erb file extension from form partials!
