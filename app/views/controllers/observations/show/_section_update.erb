<%# locals: (identifier: "", obs: nil, user: nil, consensus: nil, sites: nil) %>

<%#
Generalized template for Turbo live partial updates of the show obs page.
This template is rendered by several controllers upon success of any action
that creates or updates a resource associated with the Observation - for
example a Naming, CollectionNumber, FungariumRecord, ExternalLink, or Sequence.

The reason this is a generalized template is because these updates should all
do at least two things, via two separate `turbo_stream` actions below:
  - Replace the relevant section of show obs
  - Update the page flash to provide user feedback
Each of the above controller responses could *explicitly* call both of these,
but this partial is intended to be more DRY, at the cost of being indirect.

Callers should pass the local_assign `identifier`, plus any locals needed by the section partial. The `identifier` is a string that should match both
  - the partial filename: views/controllers/observations/show/_#{identifier}.erb
  - the last segment of the section's HTML ID: "observation_#{identifier}"

NOTE: The section partial should also have a `data-controller="status-update"`
attribute on the outermost div. This calls the Stimulus controller to hide any
modal forms when the div gets updated by Turbo.
