<%# Images section of create_observation form
Gotcha: thumb_image_id
Although there can be radio buttons for selecting observation[thumb_image_id] 
in both the good_images and the images_upload partials, they currently *do
not* set the observation thumb_image_id: their value is transferred by JS to  
the hidden_field below with the same name, which takes precedence.
I believe this is because in images_upload/_template.erb, the radio buttons
do not yet have an image.id value, the image has not yet been uploaded.
