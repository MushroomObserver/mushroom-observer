<%# Images section of create_observation form
Gotcha: observation[thumb_image_id] is set by JS, not by radio buttons.
Although there can be radio buttons for selecting thumb_image_id
in both the good_images and the images_upload partials, they currently *do
not* set the observation[thumb_image_id]: their value is transferred by JS to
the hidden_field below with a similar name, which takes precedence.
This is because when images are being uploaded, the radio buttons
do not yet have an image.id value - the image record has not yet been created.
Also, note that `good_images` is currently not a field under observation,
i.e. observation[good_images]. It's a top-level field. --%>
