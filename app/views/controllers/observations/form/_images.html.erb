<%# Images section of create_observation form
Gotcha: observation[thumb_image_id] is set by JS, not by radio buttons.
Although there can be radio buttons for selecting observation[thumb_image_id]
in both the good_images and the images_upload partials, they currently *do
not* set the observation thumb_image_id: their value is transferred by JS to
the hidden_field below with the same name, which takes precedence.
I believe this is because in images_upload/_template.erb, the radio buttons
do not yet have an image.id value - the image has not yet been uploaded.
Also, note that `good_images` is currently not a field under observation,
i.e. observation[good_images]. It's a top-level field. --%>

                       @good_images.map { |img| img.id }.join(" "),
                       data: { form_images_target: "goodImages" }) %>

  <%= f.hidden_field(:thumb_image_id,
                     data: { form_images_target: "thumbImageId" }) %>
