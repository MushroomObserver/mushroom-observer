<%# it's a double-duty form with two different commit buttons.
the edit links un-collapse the edit key notes field with a save button,
and the checkboxes are for the remove button at the bottom.

Could instead be separate edit forms, with a remove button on each line. %>

<%= make_table(headers: api_keys_edit_form_headers,
               rows: api_keys_edit_form_rows(@user),
               table_opts: { class: "table-striped"}) %>
