<p>To the Mushroom Observer Community:</p>
<p>It has long been Nathan's policy that Mushroom Observer remain open to the entire community, both amateurs and professionals of all levels.  We have gone to extreme lengths to solve disagreements and conflicts between our users without resorting to moderation or other top-down measures of control. It is our strong opinion that when given the appripriate tools and freedom, communities have the ability to solve their differences constructively without third party intervention.</p>
<p>However, this is predicated on users treating each other with respect.  Over the past few years I have noticed a steady decrease in this level of mutual respect in our community.  Several users in particular are responsible for the vast majority of the problems.  You know who you are.  Nathan, Joe and I have listened to your complaints both in the public forum and off-line in email conversations, and even occasionally over the phone and in person.  And we have done our best to find constructive solutions which can work for everyone.</p>
<p>Nathan changed jobs a few years ago and between the huge demands of his new position and spending time with family and (recently) health problems, he has found very little time to devote to development.  For my own part, my work in lichenology has increased dramatically over the past few years and I, too, no longer have time to take an active part in development or administration of the site.  My role is strictly advisory, and helping in times of crisis. Thankfully, Joe Cohen has stepped up in our absence and through phenomenal patience and good humor has managed to keep the ship afloat. </p>
<p>This summer in particular has been difficult for us all.  I have been in the field for most of the summer, remaining off the grid for weeks at a time. When I returned a few weeks ago, with Nathan regrettably completely absent for the forseeable future, I find myself the defacto interim owner of Mushroom Observer.</p>
<p>Imagine then, if you will, my surprise to find many of our most active and valued users attacking me with often downright abusive language from all sides of the debate on this Imageless issue.  As the only person presently capable of helping any of you in any meaningful way, it really strains my credulity. </p>
<p>From here until the end of my hopefully short reign, I will no longer tolerate disrespectful emails, posts, pull requests, pivotal stories or any other form of communication that reaches my inbox.  Byrain has the dubious honor of being the first to go.  He has repeatedly used profanity in messages to me.  He has repeatedly ignored good faith requests to hear his side of issues.  And he has been given ample warning by both Joe and me, and chose to ignore us and persist in vandalizing people's observations first with inappropriate uses of the name Imageless, and now with a new surrogate, Bilderlos.  No open respectful community can persist in the face of such characters.</p>
<p>Nathan and I have always welcomed dissent.  We always read every email suggestion and complaint sent to the admins, and we have always taken every one seriously.  But our core policies of openness, and self-regulation by an empowered community of peers are not up for debate.  Our policy on imageless observations has also been made crystal clear and is not up for debate. Restating your disagreement with these core policies for the hundredth time, hoping that mere volume or abusiveness is somehow going to change our minds, or magically create the time for us to implement the structural changes which might help your particular pet cause, is not helpful.  And from now on runs the serious risk of temporary suspension of your account. </p>
<p>Lastly, use of MO to post abusive comments or to send abusive emails to other users, needless to say, is not acceptable.  This applies just as much to users whom I count as friends.  Again, you know who you are.</p>
<p>Joe and I will be out of town for the next few weeks.  We will only have intermittant access to email.  Until then MO will largely be on autopilot. I will not be inclined to patience when I return.</p>
<p>Those of you who have been supportive and who do your best to ignore these childish battles, those of you who are just interested in learning and sharing your knowledge of mushrooms: please accept my regrets that it has to come to this, and that you would have to read a letter such as this.  Let's hope cooler heads such as yours will finally prevail, and we can go back to the good ol' days when we actually looked forward to notifications from MO in our inbox. You folks, too, know who your are.  Thank you for being there.</p>
