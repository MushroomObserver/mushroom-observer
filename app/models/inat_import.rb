# == Attributes
#
#  user::                  user who initiated the iNat import
#  state::                 state of the import
#  ended_at::              when the job was Done
#  token::                 token used to validate request; can be a code,
#                          authorization token, or JWT
#                          depending on the state of the import
#                          https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/api+reference#authorization_code_flow
#  inat_ids::              string of id's of iNat obss to be imported
#  inat_username::         iNat login of user whose obss are being imported
#                          Appended to iNat API query in order to generally
#                          an MO user from importing someone else's iNat obss
#  import_all:             whether to import all of user's relevant iNat obss
#  importables::           number of importable observations in job
#  imported_count::        running count of iNat obss imported in associated job
#  response_errors::       string of newline-separated error messages
#  total_imported_count::  historical count of iNat obss imported by this user
#  total_seconds::         all-time seconds this user spent importing iNat obss
#  avg_import_time         user's historical seconds per import
#  last_obs_start          when started importing a single iNat obs
#                          reset in InatImportsController#authorization_response
#                          and in Job after each observation import
#  cancel/canceled::       Did the user requested canceling the Job
#
# == Methods
