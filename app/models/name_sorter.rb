#  = Name Sorter
#
#  This class is used by a few controllers (e.g.  NameController,
#  SpeciesListController) to help parse lists of names, such as in
#  bulk_name_edit, create/edit_species_list, and change_synonyms.  It uses
#  NameParse to parse individual lines, then gathers unrecognized names,
#  deprecated names, accepted names, etc.
#
#  This is extraordinarily complicated-looking, but once you've worked out the
#  execution flow and what the method and attribute names mean, you'll see that
#  it's not so bad.  Still, I'd caution against making any changes here unless
#  you really know what you're doing.
#
#  1. First create and populate object:
#    sorter = NameSorter.new
#
#    # Pass in a list of name strings, or one string at a time.
#    sorter.sort_names(list_of_name_strs)
#    sorter.add_name(name_str)
#
#    # After the first pass, if there were names with multiple matches, the user
#    # may choose which ones they mean.
#    sorter.add_chosen_names(hash_mapping_name_ids_to_name_ids)
#
#    # Likewise, after the first pass, the user can tell NameSorter that it's
#    # okay to use certain deprecated names.
#    sorter.add_approved_deprecated_names(list_of_name_strings)
#
#    # Likewise, after the first pass, if some names are deprecated, the user
#    # may choose which approved synonyms they want to use.
#    sorter.append_approved_synonyms(list_of_name_ids)
#    sorter.push_synonym(id_or_name)
#
#  2. Now query object:
#
#    # Check an external list of Names for unapproved deprecated names.  (The
#    # second version takes a hash that you get back from a list of checkboxes.)
#    # These set the internal flag below, has_unapproved_deprecated_names.
#    check_for_deprecated_names(list_of_names)
#    check_for_deprecated_checklist(checkbox_list)
#
#    # Have all deprecated names that are left been approved by the user?
#    has_unapproved_deprecated_names
#
#    # Are all names recognized and unambiguously match a single Name?
#    only_single_names
#
#    # Has the user entered any "Species one = Species two" lines?
#    # (This syntax is not allowed while populating species lists, for example.)
#    has_new_synonyms
#
#    # Checks to make sure user had a chance to choose from among the synonyms
#    # of any name they've listed that has synonyms.  This is a bit misnamed.
#    only_approved_synonyms
#
#  == Note on Timestamps
#
#  When adding names to the sorter (e.g., via +add_name+ or +sort_names+), you
#  can include timestamps.  This can be used, for example, by the SpeciesList
#  constructor to specify the date each species was observed, overriding the
#  default date that is implicitly given each Observation.  This was originally
#  used only by some external script Nathan wrote for Darvin.  I've now hooked
#  up the comment mechanism to give web users access to this feature, too.  The
#  syntax would look like this:
#
#    Abrothallus hypotrachynae [20100320]
#    Paraparmelia alabamensis [2010-03-21]
#    Cladonia strepsilis [2010/3/22 2:30pm]
#
#  (Basically, include anything that +Time.parse+ would recognize inside square
#  brackets after the name.  It will be interpreted in the browser's local
#  time zone.)
