# Resolves the name using these heuristics:
#   First time through:
#     Only 'what' will be filled in.
#     Prompts the user if not found.
#     Gives user a list of options if matches more than one. ('names')
#     Gives user a list of options if deprecated. ('valid_names')
#   Second time through:
#     'what' is a new string if user typed new name, else same as old 'what'
#     'approved_name' is old 'what'
#     'chosen_name' hash on name.id: radio buttons
#     Uses the name chosen from the radio buttons first.
#     If 'what' has changed, then go back to "First time through" above.
#     Else 'what' has been approved, create it if necessary.
#
# INPUTS:
#   what           params[:naming][:name]          Text field.
#   approved_name  params[:approved_name]          Last name user entered.
#   chosen_name    params[:chosen_name][:name_id]  Name id from radio boxes.
#   (User.current -- might be used by one or more things)
#
# RETURNS:
#   success       true: okay to use name; false: user needs to approve name.
#   name          Name object if it resolved without reservations.

#   Used by form_name_feedback if name not resolved:
#   names         List of choices if name matched multiple objects.
#   valid_names   List of choices if name is deprecated.
