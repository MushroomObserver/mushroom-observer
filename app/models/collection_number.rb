#
#  = CollectionNumbers Model
#
#  Represents a voucher specimen's collector and number.  A single specimen
#  can potentially have more than one collection number in strange cases, but
#  usually it will be one-to-one.  However there is no object in MO which
#  represents a physical voucher collection / specimen.
#
#  CollectionNumber records are associated with Observation(s) (again possibly
#  more than one), and indirectly through them they are associated with
#  HerbariumRecord(s) and finally an Herbarium (or more than one).
#
#  In the typical case, when an observation with a physical voucher collection
#  is created, both one CollectionNumber and one HerbariumRecord (typically at
#  the user's personal herbarium) are also created.  When the specimen is sent
#  to another institution, a new HerbariumRecord will be created.  There is no
#  way at present to track in which physical Herbarium a physical specimen
#  actually resides.
#
#  Note that changing a CollectionNumber will automatically indirectly affect
#  any Observation associated with it.  However, note that if an
#  HerbariumRecord contains the collector's name and/or number (e.g. in the
#  user's personal herbarium's herbarium_label), this will not be changed
#  automatically.  The controller will have to check for this and make the
#  change to the HerbariumRecord(s) separately.
#
#  == Attributes
#
#  id::          Locally unique numerical id, starting at 1.
#  user_id::     Id of User who created this record.
#  created_at::  Date/time this record was created.
#  updated_at::  Date/time this record was last updated.
#  name::        Collector's full name, not necessarily same as creator.
#  number::      Collector's unique number (uniqueness not enforced).
#
#  == Class methods

#  observations::    Observation's associated with this collection number.
#  add_observation:: Add CollectionNumber to Observation, log it and save.
