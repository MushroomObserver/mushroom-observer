#  = HerbariumRecords Model
#
#  Represents a record of a physical collection at an herbarium.  Each time
#  a specimen is accessioned at an herbarium it will be given a label and a
#  unique identifier.  This info can be stored in this record.
#
#  Each HerbariumRecord belongs to an Herbarium, and can belong to one or
#  more Observation(s).  Note that either an observer or an Herbarium curator
#  can create one of these records.
#
#  See also CollectionNumber.
#
