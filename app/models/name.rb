#  = Name Model
#
#  This model describes a single scientific name.  The related class Synonym,
#  which can own multiple Name's, more accurately embodies the abstract concept
#  of a species.  A Name, on the other hand, refers to a single epithet, in a
#  single sense -- that is, a unique combination of genus, species, and author.
#  (Name also embraces infraspecies and extrageneric taxa as well.)
#
#  == Name Formats
#
#    text_name          "Xanthoparmelia" coloradoensis
#    (real_text_name)   "Xanthoparmelia" coloradoënsis
#                         (derived on the fly from display_name)
#    search_name        "Xanthoparmelia" coloradoensis Fries
#    (real_search_name) "Xanthoparmelia" coloradoënsis Fries
#                         (derived on the fly from display_name)
#    sort_name          Xanthoparmelia" coloradoensis Fries
#    display_name       **__"Xanthoparmelia" coloradoënsis__** Fries
#    observation_name   **__"Xanthoparmelia" coloradoënsis__** Fries
#                         (adds "sp." on the fly for genera)
#
#    text_name          Amanita muscaria var. muscaria
#                         (pure text, no accents or authors)
#    (real_text_name)   Amanita muscaria var. muscaria
#                         (minus authors, but with umlauts if exist)
#    search_name        Amanita muscaria var. muscaria (L.) Lam.
#                         (what one would typically search for)
#    (real_search_name) Amanita muscaria (L.) Lam. var. muscaria
#                         (parsing this should result in identical name)
#    sort_name          Amanita muscaria  {6var.  !muscaria  (L.) Lam.
#                         (nonsense string which sorts name in correct place)
#    display_name       **__Amanita muscaria__** (L.) Lam. var. **__muscaria__**
#                         (formatted as for publication)
#    observation_name   **__Amanita muscaria__** (L.) Lam. var. **__muscaria__**
#                         (formatted as for publication)
#
#  Note about "real" text_name and search_name: These are required by edit
#  forms.  If the user inputs a name with an accent (ë is the only one
#  allowed), but there is an error or warning that requires the user to
#  resubmit the form, we need to be able to fill the field in with the correct
#  name *including* the umlaut.  That is, if you re-parse real_search_name, it
#  must result in the identical Name object.  This is not true of search_name,
#  because it will lose the umlaut.
#
#  == Regular Expressions
#
#  These are the sorts of things the regular expressions match:
#
#  GENUS_OR_UP_PAT::  (Xxx) sp? (Author)
#  SUBGENUS_PAT::     (Xxx subgenus yyy) (Author)
#  SECTION_PAT::      (Xxx ... sect. yyy) (Author)
#  SUBSECTION_PAT:    (Xxx ... subsect. yyy) (Author)
#  STIRPS_PAT::       (Xxx ... stirps yyy) (Author)
#  SPECIES_PAT:       (Xxx yyy) (Author)
#  SUBSPECIES_PAT::   (Xxx yyy ssp. zzz) (Author)
#  VARIETY_PAT::      (Xxx yyy ... var. zzz) (Author)
#  FORM_PAT::         (Xxx yyy ... f. zzz) (Author)
#  GROUP_PAT::        (Xxx yyy ...) group or clade
#  AUTHOR_PAT:        (any of the above) (Author)
#
#
#  * Results are grouped according to the parentheses shown above.
#  * Extra whitespace allowed on ends and in middle.
#  * Epithets ("Xxx" and "yyy" above) may contain any letters, including
#    "e" with umlaut, and embedded dashes.
#  * Specific epithets ("yyy" above) may be surrounded by double-quotes.
#  * Authors can be virtually anything: they start at the second uppercase
#    letter or any punctuation mark not allowed in the epithet patterns.
#  * "Whatever" is anything starting with an uppercase.
#  * Lastly, "comment" is anthing at all inside square brackets.
#
#  == Misspellings
#
#  As an intermediate solution, misspelled names should be synonymized with the
#  correct name, and the id of the correct Name placed in correct_spelling_id.
#  This has three results: the misspelled name is removed from auto-completion
#  lists and name_lister; show_name will include this in the "real" list of
#  Observation's instead of the "synonym" list.
#
#  == Classification
#
#  Taxonomic classification is currently a big hodgepodge of heuristics.  Taxa
#  at and below genus are handled by straight-forward parsing.  Taxa above
#  genus require a +classification+ string.  Taxa below genus should _not_ have
#  a +classification+ string (it is probably ignored?) _All_ taxa from genus
#  and up must have a +classification+ string if you want access to that
#  taxon's parents, and for taxa above genus, that taxon's children.  Note,
#  there is a lot of redundancy: even if a genus supplies its entire
#  classification, its parents must _also_ supply their entire classification.
#
#  *NOTE*: The classification string is sort of shared between the Name and
#  NameDescription instances.  It is structural, so it sort of belongs here,
#  however, at the same time, we want to allow draft descriptions to own a
#  copy.  Thus it is stored in both.  The one in Name is set whenever the
#  official NameDescription's copy changes.  Think of the one in Name as
#  caching the official version.
#
#  == Version

#  Changes are kept in the "names_versions" table using
#  ActiveRecord::Acts::Versioned.
