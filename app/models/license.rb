# frozen_string_literal: true

#
#  = License Model
#
#  Very simple model to hold info about a copyright license.  Originally
#  intended for use by Image, but now extended to Name Descriptions.
#
#  == Deprecation
#
#  Instead of deleting out-dated License's, since that would involve finding
#  and updating thousands of records, we just "deprecate" them instead.  This
#  has the effect of removing it from pulldown menus in the HTML forms.
#
#  == Attributes
#
#  id::           Locally unique numerical id, starting at 1.
#  updated_at::   Date/time it was last updated.
#  deprecated::   Has this been deprecated?
#  display_name:: Name, e.g., "Creative Commons Non-commercial v2.5"
#  form_name::    Code, e.g., "ccbyncsa25"
#  url::          URL,  e.g., "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/"
#
#  == Class methods
#
#  current_names_and_ids::  List non-deprecated License names/ids.
#
#  == Instance methods
#
#  images::                 Array of Image's that use this License.
#  users::                  Array of User's for whom this is the default License
#  location_descriptions::  Array of Name's that use this License.
#  name_descriptions::      Array of Name's that use this License.
#  text_name::              Alias for +display_name+ for debugging.
#
#  == Callbacks
#
#  None.
