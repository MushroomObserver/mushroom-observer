#  = External Link Model
#
#  An external link is a URL attached to a single observation which links to a
#  related record on an external site.  It is associated with a record in the
#  external_sites table, which potentially eventually among other things, tells
#  the site who is allowed to create external links to that site.  It is
#  important to note that only the owner of an observation and users associated
#  with an external_site (via an external_site's project's member user_group)
#  are allowed to attach a URL for that external_site to that observation.
#
#  (Wow, that was difficult to write...)
#
#  == Attributes
#
#  id::            Locally unique numerical id, starting at 1.
#  created_at::    Date/time it was first created.
#  updated_at::    Date/time it was last updated.
#  user::          User that created it.
#  observation::   Observation the URL is attached to.
#  external_site:: External site the URL points to.
#  url::           Actual URL, complete with transport ("http://"), etc.
