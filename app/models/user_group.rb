#
#  = User Group Model
#
#  Model that describes a group of Users.  It used to be pretty
#  straight-forward.  There are now two new classes of groups that muddy the
#  waters: "all users" and "user N".  The first contains all users, whether
#  they are verified or not.  The second is a set of groups, one for each user,
#  each containing just that user and no others.  Both of these "meta-groups"
#  are considered "frozen" in that they can not be updated.  (Obviously,
#  "all users" is updated every time a user is created or destroyed, but no
#  user is allowed to make changes to it, even the admins.)
#
#  == Attributes
#
#  id::         Locally unique numerical id, starting at 1.
#  created_at:: Date/time it was first created.
#  updated_at:: Date/time it was last updated.
#  name::       Name of the group, must be unique.
#  meta::       Can members be added or removed from this group?
#
#  == Class methods
#
#  all_users::      Return the meta-group that contains all users.
#  one_user::       Return the meta-group that contains just the given user.
#  reviewers::      Return the group of "reviewers".
#
#  == Instance methods
#
#  users::          List of Users in the group.
#  project::        Project, if one defines their membership using this group.
#  admin_project::  Project, if one defines their admins using this group.
#  text_name::      Alias for +name+ for debugging.
#
#  == Callbacks
#
#  create_user::    Called after a new User is created.
#  destroy_user::   Called after a new User is destroyed.
