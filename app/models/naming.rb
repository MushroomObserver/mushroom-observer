#
#  = Naming Model
#
#  Naming's are used to associate a proposed Name with an Observation.  An
#  Observation generally has one or more Naming's, but it can also have none,
#  meaning that it is unidentified.
#
#  == Attributes
#
#  id::                     Locally unique numerical id, starting at 1.
#  created_at::             Date/time it was created.
#  updated_at::             Date/time it was last updated.
#  user::                   User that created it.
#  observation::            Observation it is attached to.
#  name::                   Name it refers to.
#  vote_cache::             Weighted sum of votes for this Naming, cached.
#  reasons::                Serialized Hash containing reasons.
#
#  == Class methods
#
#  None.
#
#  == Instance methods
#
#  ==== Formatting
#  text_name::              Plain text.  (uses name.search_name)
#  format_name::            Textilized.  (uses name.observation_name)
#  unique_text_name::       Same as above, with id added to make unique.
#  unique_format_name::     Same as above, with id added to make unique.
#
#  ==== Voting
#  votes::                  List of Vote's attached to this Naming.
#  vote_sum::               Straight sum of Vote's for this Naming.
#  vote_percent::           Convert cached Vote score to a percentage.
#  user_voted?::            Has a given User voted on this Naming?
#  users_vote::             Get a given User's Vote on this Naming.
#  users_favorite?::        Is this Naming the given User's favorite?
#  change_vote::            Call Observation#change_vote.
#  editable?::              Can owner change this Naming's Name?
#  deletable?::             Can owner delete this Naming?
#  calc_vote_table::        (Used by show_votes.rhtml.)
#
#  == Callbacks
#
#  did_name_change?::       Check if name changed before saving.
#  create_emails::          Notify users of changes after saving.
#  log_destruction::        Log destruction after destroying it.
#  enforce_default_reasons:: Make sure default reasons are set in if none given.
