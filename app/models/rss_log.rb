#  = RSS Log Model
#
#  This model handles the RSS feed.  Every object we care about gets an RssLog
#  instance to report changes in that object.  Going forward, every new object
#  gets assigned one; historically, there are loads of objects without, but we
#  don't really care, so they stay that way until they are updated.
#
#  There is a separate <tt>#{object}_id</tt> field for each kind of object that
#  can own an RssLog.  I thought it would be cleaner to use a polymorphic
#  association, however that makes it impossible to eager-load different
#  associations for the different types of owners.  The resulting performance
#  hit was significant.
#
#  List of models which log activity are presently:
#
#  * Article
#  * GlossaryTerm
#  * Location
#  * Name
#  * Observation
#  * Project
#  * SpeciesList
#
#  == Adding RssLog to Model
#
#  This might be out of date, but start with these steps:
#
#  1) Database: Add columns to rss_logs and new model tables via migration.
#
#       class AddRssLogToModel < ActiveRecord::Migration
#         def self.change
#           add_column(:rss_logs, :model_id, :integer)
#           add_column(:models, :rss_log_id, :integer)
#         end
#       end
#
#  2) New model: Create association, tell it which actions (if any) to
#     automatically log, provide standard title methods.  (Note that
#     AbstractModel will provide the +log+ method. The optional exclamation
#     points tell it to pop the object to the top of the Activity Log.)
#
#       belongs_to :rss_log
#       self.autolog_events = [:created!, :updated!, :destroyed!]
#       def text_name
#       def format_name
#       def unique_text_name
#       def unique_format_name
#
#  3) RssLog: Create association, add type to RssLog.all_types.
#
#       belongs_to :model
#       self.all_types # add "model"
#
#  4) View: Modify MatrixBoxPresenter if who/what/when/where are nonstandard.
#
#  5) Add "show log" link at bottom of model's show page:
#
#       <%= show_object_footer(@object) %>
#
#  6) Add +by_rss_log+ flavor to Query for your model:
#
#       self.allowed_model_flavors = {
#         :Model => [
#           :by_rss_log, # Models with RSS logs, in RSS order.
#         ]
#       }
#
#  == Usage
#
#  AbstractModel provides a standardized interface for all models that handle
#  RssLog (see the list above).  These are inherited automatically by any model
#  that contains an "rss_log_id" column.
#
#    rss_log = observation.rss_log
#    rss_log.add("Made some change.")
#    rss_log.orphan("Deleting observation.")
#
#  *NOTE*: After an object is deleted, no one will ever be able to change that
#  RssLog again -- i.e. it is orphaned.
#
#  == Log Syntax
#
#  The log is kept in a variable-length text field, +notes+.  Each entry is
#  stored as a single line, with newest entries first.  Each line has time
#  stamp, localization string and any arguments required.  If the underlying
#  object is destroyed, the log becomes orphaned, and the object's last known
#  title string is stored at the very top of the log.
#
#  Here is an example of an Observation's log with five entries created by two
#  high-level actions: it is first created along with two images and a naming;
#  then it is destroyed, orphaning the log:
#
#    **__Russula%20chloroides__**%20Krbh.
#    20091214035011 log_observation_destroyed user douglas
#    20090722075919 log_image_created name 51164 user douglas
#    20090722075919 log_image_created name 51163 user douglas
#    20090722075919 log_consensus_changed
#      new **__Russula%20chloroides__**%20Krbh.
#      old **__Fungi%20sp.__**%20L.
#    20090722075918 log_observation_created user douglas
#
#  *NOTE*: All non-alphanumeric characters are escaped via private class
#  methods +escape+ and +unescape+.
#
#  *NOTE*: Somewhere in 2008/2009 we changed the syntax of the logs so we could
#  translate them.  We made the deliberate decision _not_ to convert all the
#  pre-existing logs... But apparently at some later point we decided to convert
#  the old logs after all.  So, everything is now more or less correct.
#  Although, note that many orphaned logs point to nonexistent targets
#  (that is, target_id was never cleared), and still others (rare cases)
#  never had the target title added to the top of the log (and therefore the
#  log will claim it's not an orphan even though it is).  This latter is
#  definitely a bug or residue of unclean shutdown or something, but it's not
#  clear how to fix it.  Just be aware and write resilient code!
#
#  == Attributes

#  notes::              Log of changes.
#  name, name_id::      Owning Name (or nil).
#  etc.::               (Pair of methods for each type of model.)
#
#  == Class methods
#
#  all_types::          Object types with RssLog's (Array of Symbol's).
#
#  == Instance methods
#
#  add_with_date::      Same, but adds timestamp.
#  orphan::             About to delete object: add object title and notes.
#  orphan_title::       Get old title from top line of orphaned log.
#  orphan?::            Has rss_log been orphaned? (i.e., target destroyed?)
#  target::             Return owner object: Observation, Name, etc.
#  text_name::          Return title string of associated object.
#  format_name::        Return formatted title string of associated object.
#  unique_text_name::   (same, with id tacked on to make unique)
#  unique_format_name:: (same, with id tacked on to make unique)
#  url::                Return "show_blah/id" URL for associated object.
#  parse_log::          Parse log, see method for description of return value.
