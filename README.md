This README provides a quick overview of the tools used by Mushroom Observer
(MO) and an overview of the other READMEs that accompany this file.  See
<http://mushroomobserver.org/observer/intro> for an introduction to the website
itself.

Tools
-----

Source code control: The source code for MO is currently managed using git
and is hosted on github. The URL for the MO source repository is
<https://github.com/MushroomObserver/mushroom-observer>.

To get started developing we recommend that you head over to
<https://github.com/MushroomObserver/developer-startup> which provides
instructions for getting a development environment setup on Mac, Linux
and Windows machines.

Other READMEs
-------------

The following files should provide useful information for working with the
Mushroom Observer code base.  Note that we are not great at keeping these up
to date, so be sure to take them with a grain of salt proportional to the
Last Revised date.

README_CODE: Provides a snapshot of the major components of Mushroom Observer.

README_DEVELOPMENT_INSTALL: Describes the steps needed for a developer to get
the code running locally. Though we recommend following the process outlined
at <https://github.com/MushroomObserver/developer-startup>.
You are encouraged to update this document with your own experience.

README_PRODUCTION_INSTALL: Describes the steps needed to setup our production
environment.

README_STANDARDS: The closest we have to coding standards.  Currently this is
*very* brief.

README_TRANSLATIONS: Details needed for translators to provide support in for
the site in a new language.
