Install the new version of Ruby as root into /opt/rubies/ruby-<version>:

  ssh mushroomobserver.org
  sudo su -
  ruby-install ruby <version> -i /opt/rubies/ruby-<version>

The above takes a while and can be done prior to commiting to doing
the deploy.

Once the new version of Ruby is tested and working for the development
team and the PR is merged:

  sudo su mo
  cd /var/web/mo
  chruby ruby-3.3.6
  git stash
  git pull
  git stash pop
  bundle install

Make sure there are no errors or important warnings.
    
  deploy
