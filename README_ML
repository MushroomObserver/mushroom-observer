This are notes on running the current machine learning model for MO.

The current model was created by Alan Celestino in 2020.  It uses an
older version of fast.ai.  We expect to upgrade it soon with a new model
and a more consistent deployment strategy.

For now, the model runs on images.mushroomobserver.org.  To run it sudo to mo
and run:

mo> conda activate classifier

If this fails (typically because Anaconda package hasn't been created), try:

mo> conda create -n classifier python
mo> conda activate classifier

Once the above is working, run:

mo> cd ~acelestino/mushroom_api
mo> python api.py &

If this fails (typically complaining about not being able to find flask), try:

mo> conda install -c fastai -c pytorch -c anaconda -c conda-forge fastai anaconda pillow flask flask-restful
mo> python api.py &

You can now exit the shell.
