Performance/Casecmp:

Performance/RegexpMatch:
  # Autocorrect changes "something.match(regexp)" to "something.match?(regexp)".

Style/FrozenStringLiteralComment:
  # When it's auto-corrected in Ruby 2.4, our test suite won't run.
  # We get: "can't modify frozen String" error
  # Rubocop describes this cop as:
  #
  # This cop is designed to help upgrade to Ruby 3.0.
  # It will add the comment  # frozen_string_literal: true to the top of files
  # to enable frozen string literals.
  # Frozen string literals may be default in Ruby 3.0.
  # The comment will be added below a shebang and encoding comment.
  # The frozen string literal comment is only valid in Ruby 2.3+.
