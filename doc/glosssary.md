# Pulk

1. Everyone is welcome to contribute to the glossary. Any mycology-specific terms are welcome in the glossary, especially terms relating to the identification, taxonomy, nomenclature, and ecology of macrofungi.

2. Terms that lack a mycology-specific definition should be avoided.

3. Terms that are scientific names of fungi should be avoided (better described on their own name pages).

4. Terms that are straightforward modifications or combinations of other terms should not have their own definitions, but are welcome to be given entries with illustrations.

5. Entry titles (terms) should be lowercase, except for proper nouns.

6. Definitions should be original (not copied) text.

7. Definitions should be formed of complete sentences or (preferably) match the part-of-speech of the term they define. E.g., a definition for a noun might begin with "A sterile cell that..." and one for an adjective might begin with "Bearing cystidia that..."

8. Definitions should be numbered when (and only when) multiple definitions are included.

Two other things I'm thinking could be useful -

(A) a model glossary entry, with all the extra little parts included (plural, alternate spellings, links to other terms to compare...) formatted in the way other entries should follow

(B) ability to propose deletion of an entry

# Index

In collaboration with the Rhode Island School of Design, students from Jean Blackburnâ€™s Scientific Illustration class to create high-quality Creative Commons licensed scientific illustrations of fungal anatomy terms. To share these works, this new glossary feature for Mushroom Observer was created.
This release provides the bare minimum of functionality to be able to discover and view these illustrations. New glossary terms can also be created by anyone in the community. Currently these terms are illustrated by single images, but my intent is to add support for multiple images including both scientific illustrations and example photographs. There will also be a search feature, the ability to add links to terms as part of any Mushroom Observer markup. A particular feature that needs discussion is how best to handle translations of these terms and their definitions. Discussion of these features including additional desired terms are welcome on either the Mushroom Observer mailing list (mo-general@googlegroups.com) or the unofficial Mushroom Observer Facebook page.
