#   * `Zip::OutputStream`

# Please ensure that your Gemfiles and .gemspecs are suitably restrictive
# to avoid an unexpected breakage when 3.0 is released (e.g. ~> 2.3.0).
# See https://github.com/rubyzip/rubyzip for details. The Changelog also

########## GraphQL API ########################################

# GraphQL-Ruby
# https://github.com/rmosolgo/graphql-ruby
gem("graphql")
#
# Note: Some of the following gems are experimental at this point 1/22
#
# Debug future changes in GraphQL API
# Takes two GraphQL schemas and outputs a list of changes between versions
# gem("graphql-schema_comparator")
#
# Authorization gem
# Action Policy is an authorization library for your GraphQL Ruby application
# gem("action_policy-graphql")
#
# Pagination & Connection gems
#
# Additional implementations of cursor-based paginations for GraphQL Ruby.
# Extends classes of graphql-ruby
# Use with GraphQL::Connections::Stable
# https://github.com/bibendi/graphql-connections
gem("graphql-connections")
#
# Allows cursor pagination through an ActiveRecord relation.
# Supports ordering by any column, ascending or descending.
# Use with the RailsCursorPagination::Paginator class.
# https://github.com/xing/rails_cursor_pagination
# gem("rails_cursor_pagination")
#
# Implements page-based pagination returning collection and pagination metadata.
# It works with kaminari or other pagination tools implementing similar methods.
# https://github.com/RenoFi/graphql-pagination
# gem("graphql-pagination")
# gem("kaminari-activerecord")
#
# Dataloading gems
# Note that dataloader comes shipped with graphql gem as of 1.12
# It's also experimental. Below are some alternatives
# https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/how-to-graphql-with-ruby-rails-active-record-and-no-n-plus-one
#
# Provides an executor for the graphql gem which allows queries to be batched.
# Defined in loaders/record_loader.rb RecordLoader < GraphQL::Batch::Loader
# Used in queries and resolvers like
# def product(id:) RecordLoader.for(Product).load(id)
# def products(ids:) RecordLoader.for(Product).load_many(ids)
# https://github.com/Shopify/graphql-batch
gem("graphql-batch")
#
# Brings association lazy load functionality to your Rails applications
# Use like User.lazy_preload(:posts).limit(10)
# https://github.com/DmitryTsepelev/ar_lazy_preload
# gem("ar_lazy_preload")
#
# (Similar to graphql-batch and maybe ar_lazy_preload. Maybe better?)
# Provides a generic lazy batching mechanism to avoid N+1 DB queries,
# HTTP queries, etc.
# https://github.com/exAspArk/batch-loader
# https://github.com/exAspArk/batch-loader#alternatives
# gem("batch-loader")
#
# (Similar to ar_lazy_preload)
# Old add-on to graphql-ruby that allows your field resolvers to minimize N+1
# SELECTS issued by ActiveRecord. Possibly overlaps above ar_lazy_preload
# https://github.com/nettofarah/graphql-query-resolver
# gem("graphql-query-resolver")
#
# Caching gems
#
# Persisted Queries. Backend will cache all the queries, while frontend will
# send the full query only when it's not found at the backend storage.
# Use with apollo persisted queries
# https://github.com/DmitryTsepelev/graphql-ruby-persisted_queries
# gem("graphql-persisted_queries")
#
# Cache response fragments: you can mark any field as cached
# https://github.com/DmitryTsepelev/graphql-ruby-fragment_cache
# gem("graphql-fragment_cache")
#
# Need to cache and instrument your GraphQL code in Ruby? Look no further!
