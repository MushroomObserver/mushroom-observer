#  Rails Comments
#
#  Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
#  and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
#  than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
#  To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#      I18n.t 'hello'
#
#  In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#      <%= t('hello') %>
#
#  To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#      I18n.locale = :es
#
#  This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
#  To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
#  available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

#
#  MO Differences
#
#  In MO, locales files are created and modified differently.  One should never
#  change the locale.yml files by hand.  And further, how to change the
#  translations is different for English (the "official" language) than the
#  other languages.
#
#  English:  ""
#
#  Change and check in en.txt (not en.yml!), and run "rake lang:update"
#  both locally and on the production server to pick up the changes.
#  This should be the *only* way we make changes to the English "translations".
#  Any other method will get clobbered next time someone runs "rake lang:update".
#
#  Other languages:
#
#  Option one: "Export" a .txt file, e.g., es.txt ("rake lang:export:es"),
#  change the exported file, then import that on the server into the live
#  database ("rake lang:import:es").
#
#  Option two: Change the translations on the live, running site via the "Edit
#  Translations on This Page" link at the bottom of the page while viewing the
#  page in the desired language.  Any changes made here will be stored in the
#  live database, and will propagate automatically to all other currently
#  running instances immediately.
#
#  rake lang:update:
#
#  This command clobbers es.txt and es.yml, and recreates them fresh from the
#  strings stored in the database.  It does NOT clobber en.txt, making an
#  exception for that one case.  This is critical because we need to be able to
#  check this in to git.  The foreign translations are not checked into git,
#  they are considered "data" at present.  Instead, MO "imports" en.txt each
#  time "rake lang:update" is run, and syncs the English translations in the
#  database with the current data in en.txt.  Furthermore, en.txt is special in
#  one additional way: it is used as the template for the other "export" files,
#  es.txt, fr.txt, etc.  It preserves comments, order, etc. exactly like it
#  appears in en.txt.)
#
################################################################################
#
#  How to Create and Import a New Language:
#
#  First create the language in the database:
#
#    INSERT INTO languages (`locale`, `region`, `name`, `order`, `beta`)
#      VALUES (
#        "jp",          # locale, e.g. "pt" for Portuguese
#        "JP",          # region, e.g. "BR" for Brazil
#        "日本語",      # name of the language *in that language*
#        "Nihongo",     # transliteration of the above (so it sorts right)
#        1              # beta=1 means it won't appear in site's language menu
#      );
#
#  Create stub language files:
#
#    mo$ rake lang:update
#
#  Should now have an import/export file called config/locales/jp.txt.
#  Once you're done editing this file -- remembering to remove the extra space
#  between "tag:" and "value"!! -- test if it's valid:
#
#    mo$ ruby -e "require 'yaml'; YAML.load_file('config/locales/jp.txt')"
#
#  Sorry, it doesn't always tell you where the syntax errors are. Look for
#  things like "tag: [..." or "tag: blah: ..."  That should be the cause of
#  most of the grief.  Just protect those strings in quotes, remembering to
#  backslash-protect embedded quotes when you do so.
#
#  Now you should be ready to import the file.  Note that this can be redone
#  as many times as necessary if you see problems when you test it.  This is
#  why it's good to keep new languages beta!!
#
#    mo$ cp config/locales/jp.txt config/locales/jp.txt.bak
#    mo$ rake user_id=1234 lang:import:jp
#    mo$ rake lang:update
#
#  You need to supply user_id to lang:import because it needs to know who
#  created each translation_string.  You can give "user_name=xxx" instead.
#  If that works, then you should be able to test it on the server.  If you
#  need to re-import, I think it's safest to purge the old strings first:
#
#    DELETE FROM translation_strings WHERE language_id = xxx;
#
#  Note that it's important to backup the original import file, because
#  rake lang:update will clobber it.  Looking at the new jp.txt can help
#  identify problems with the import file, too.  You may even be able to
#  diff the two, depending how the translator does their work.
#
#  Once you're satisfied, repeat all this on the live server, and clear the
#  beta flag in the languages table.
#
#    UPDATE languages SET beta=0 WHERE language_id=xxx;

This has not been true since at least March of 2009.  The upgrade process started last August when we were still using the 2.1.1 version of Ruby on Rails.\n\nThis has been a huge team effort by all the volunteer developers on the project. Thanks to every one of you for helping to make this happen.\n\nFor those who are interested in the technical low-down of this specific release, we got to 4.1 last month and the biggest change between 4.1 and 4.2 was a new HTML parsing library that required many minor code changes throughout out code base. There have also been some changes to how email is handled and a variety of other small changes to the code base.  You should see no new changes in the site due to this latest upgrade, but of course <a href=\"/observer/ask_webmaster_question\">send us a note</a> if you see anything wrong."

  glossary_term_index_intro: As part of an on-going collaboration with the Rhode Island School of Design, Nathan Wilson has been working with students from Jean Blackburn's Scientific Illustration class to create high-quality Creative Commons licensed scientific illustrations of fungal anatomy terms. To share these works, Nathan created this new glossary feature for Mushroom Observer. This release provides the bare minimum of functionality to be able to discover and view these illustrations. New glossary terms can also be created by anyone in the community. Currently these terms are illustrated by single images, but my intent is to add support for multiple images including both scientific illustrations and example photographs. There will also be a search feature, the ability to add links to terms as part of any Mushroom Observer markup. A particular feature that needs discussion is how best to handle translations of these terms and their definitions. Discussion of these features including additional desired terms are welcome on either the Mushroom Observer mailing list (<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/mo-general">mo-general@googlegroups.com</a>) or the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/105230049528087/">Mushroom Observer Facebook page</a>.

  # support/letter
  letter_title: Open Letter to the Community
  letter_body: "To the Mushroom Observer Community,\n\nIt has been an amazing year for us.  This year we hit some major milestones: 100,000 images, 50,000 observations and 2,000 registered users.  This means we have essentially been doubling every year.  While Jason has achieved some minor miracles in his volunteer efforts to keep things going with the bare bones server configuration we are using, it is becoming clear that we will soon need more memory and more processors to support our continued growth.\n\nUnfortunately, this means our server expenses will be going up.  So far I have been happy to support the Mushroom Observer server needs out of my own pocket, but those expenses have also been essentially doubling every year and I will soon not be able to afford it.  As a result, I would like to start asking for donations from the community.  Those of you who have gotten a lot out of the site and want to see it continue to grow and expand, now is your chance to give a little back and help with the financial support of the site.\n\nTo that end, we have setup a \"donation page\":/support/donate that can securely accept money from a PayPal account or a regular credit card.\n\nI would like to raise at least $2000 to cover basic server costs.  The more we get, the more we can expand our capacity for traffic and growth.  And the fewer times you will encounter server down time and failed uploads.\n\nWhen you make a donation, your name by default will be added to our \"donors page\":/support/donors as soon as we confirm the donation.  If you would prefer to donate anonymously or make other special arrangements for your acknowledgement, \"send a comment\":/observer/ask_webmaster_question after you make your donation.\n\nPlease help support this active internet community of people who enjoy sharing and learning more about the mushrooms around us.\n\nThanks,\n-Nathan"

  # support/wrapup_2011
  wrapup_2011_title: 2011 Wrapup to the Mushroom Observer Community
  wrapup_2011_body: "To the Mushroom Observer Community,\n\n2011 has been a relatively quiet year for Mushroom Observer at least from the perspective of new development.  I have personally been working overtime on a new version of the Encyclopedia of Life and Jason has been working hard on a new lichen related website and book.\n\nEven so the site has continued to grow.  We now have over 180,000 images, 80,000 observations and we are very close to 3,000 registered users.  This continues our trend of nearly doubling every year.  Fortunately, due to generous donations from all of you, Jason was able to substantially upgrade our server configuration and to the best of our knowledge the system has been working very well despite the ever growing demand.  While we still have some money in the bank, we will continue to need \"additional donations\":/support/donate to keep the system going.\n\nAs was true last year, the donations are made through a not-for-profit corporation called The Consortium for Digital Mycology Resources (CDMR).  The CDMR is recognized as a non-profit by the state of California, but is still not an official federal ==501(c)(3)== non-profit.  However, the application process has moved forward and for now we continue to act as a non-profit and donations are tax deductible.  For anyone interested in the details of that process please visit the \"CDMR website\":http://digitalmycology.org.\n\nThere have been a few notable new features added to Mushroom Observer over the last year.  Jason did a great job developing the \"MO Feature Tracker\":/pivotal/index interface that interacts with our new freely accessible \"Pivotal Tracker account\":https://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/224629 for tracking bugs and feature requests.  In addition, I have been working quite a bit behind the scenes to prepare for a roughly 10 fold increase in the number of Mushroom Observer images that will be sharable with the broader biodiversity community and EOL in particular.\n\nAlong with this note, we are also releasing the newly developed \"Black on White\":/observer/BlackOnWhite color theme.  With this theme I am trying to provide a more current and professional look for the site. \"Feedback on the theme or suggestions for improvements\":/observer/ask_webmaster_question are very welcome.\n\nWhile there have not been a lot of new features released this year, there have been a number of important discussions going on about potential future development. These have included discussions of better ways of managing naming and voting so they align better with standard herbarium practices, improving the expressiveness of the voting system, rearranging the interface to be more workflow driven, and expanding the role of projects to encourage more focused collaboration within MO.\n\nWhich brings us to the biggest news.  I have begun doing some of my own research with the data from the Mushroom Observer and I have received several inquiries from other scientists interested in either using Mushroom Observer as it is to support their own research or to support additional development of the Mushroom Observer to expand the connections between Mushroom Observer and the scientific community.\n\nMy own research has included some preliminary analysis of the data in the Mushroom Observer database.  The most interesting finding has been that \"users who collect in the Western US on average find more species there than users who collect in the Eastern US\":/images/fungal_biogeography.png. I am currently in the process of developing funding and collaborators to more fully pursue this and other interesting questions that can be answered using our data.  Another area of research development has been with some of the computer scientists at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.  The group I am working with are focused on the emerging \"semantic web\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_web. We are developing a system for creating a new naming system for amateur/citizen mycologists. It will include a global, web-based registration system for names that are then associated with rigorous definitions that computers can reason about.  We have plans to support a summer internship through the EOL to help develop this idea.\n\nIn addition, as many of you are aware Tom Bruns at UC Berkeley has already been using Mushroom Observer to catalog the collections his collaborators (including many of you) have been finding in Yosemite National Park.  He and I have also begun discussions of what features would be valuable to add Mushroom Observer to support his call for developing a \"North American Mycoflora\":http://msafungi.org/wp-content/uploads/Inoculum/62(4).pdf. Another promising development was being asked to write a letter of support for a proposal that Barabara Thiers and Roy Haling have submitted to digitize the fungal herbaria throughout the US.  If that gets funded, they are interested in making their data available through the Mushroom Observer.\n\nFinally, through connections at the EOL, I was able to participate in a workshop focused on citizen science biodiversity observation systems.  The workshop was held in October outside of London and included representatives from \"iSpot\":http://www.ispot.org.uk/ and \"iNaturalist\":http://inaturalist.org along with several other significant global projects.  I went to the workshop not only to represent the technical side of the EOL, but also the Mushroom Observer.  As a result the group of projects involved in the workshop, including Mushroom Observer, are participating in a competition called \"Badges for Lifelong Learning\":http://www.dmlcompetition.net/Competition/4/badges-competition-cfp.php. We have already successfully passed the first stage of the competition and are working on our application for the second stage.\n\nWhile many of these projects promise exciting developments for MO over the next year and some may even include financial support for the development of new Mushroom Observer features, the on-going support for the site relies on \"donations\":/support/donate from you our users. Please help support this active internet community of people who enjoy sharing and learning more about the mushrooms around us.\n\nThanks for all your contributions to the Mushroom Observer,\n-Nathan"

  # support/wrapup_2012
  wrapup_2012_title: 2012 Wrapup for the Mushroom Observer Community
  wrapup_2012_body: "2012 was a busy year for Mushroom Observer.  Many notable new features were added.  Highlights include:\n\n* Substantial revisions to the <a href=\"/name/show_name/383\">Show Name</a> and <a href=\"/image/show_image/267480?size=medium\">Show Image</a> pages\n* Data downloads from observation searches\n* Support for <a href=\"/herbarium\">Herbarium</a> and Specimen pages\n* Interactive support for translators\n* <a href=\"/observer/checklist?user_id=1093\">Life Lists</a> from user summary pages\n* Substantial increase in data shared with EOL\n* Reciprocal links with <a href=\"http://mycoportal.org/\">MyCoPortal</a>\n\nMore details available on the <a href=\"/observer/news\">Features and Fixes</a> page.\n\nOne of the goals of this work has been to increase the scientific value of the site for research. The support for Herbarium and Specimen pages as well as the reciprocal links with MyCoPortal are recent steps towards this goal. This work is directly related to a new effort to digitize fungal herbaria throughout the US led by Barbara Thiers. I continue to work with Tom Bruns at UC Berkeley and Deborah McGuinness at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) to find funding to directly support improvements to the Mushroom Observer.  These projects continue to promise exciting developments for MO in the future.\n\nIn addition, the site has continued to grow.  We now have over 300,000 images, 100,000 observations, and over 3800 registered users.  This not only indicates the greatest number of images we've received in a year (106,000), but is a greater growth rate than the previous year (56% vs. 49%).\n\nFortunately, due to generous donations from all of you, we have continued to be able to improve the site configuration.  While we do have a few more tricks up our sleeves that we expect to implement soon, it is increasingly clear that more substantial improvements are needed.  Historically, we have run the site off a single server.  To achieve the next level of performance we would like to separate the database from the application server, and add an additional application server along with a small load balancer.  We expect this to roughly triple the monthly costs of running the site to around $200/month.\n\nI am also excited by a recent surge in the number of folks interested in contributing their time to the Mushroom Observer development effort.  We had a summer intern, Han Wang, from RPI create a prototype system for describing Fungi using semantic web technology (references at the end of the letter).  I presented on this work at the 2012 Mycological Society of America annual meeting.  Another RPI student, Katie Chastain, has recently joined the team and is interested in working on data provenance and developing a workflow for species discovery.  Alan Rockefeller has begun looking into improving site performance and Joe Cohen has started exploring upgrading our software stack.  If you want to join the party, sign up for the new <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/mo-developers\">mo-developers@googlegroups.com</a> mailing list.  One of the significant enabling pieces for this is a new simpler system for setting up a development environment.  You can find out more at the <a href=\"https://github.com/MushroomObserver/developer-startup\">developer-startup GitHub Project</a>.\n\nHowever, this year has not been entirely good news. The Consortium for Digital Mycology Resources (CDMR), was organized in 2009 to support online digital mycology resources such as Mushroom Observer, and it applied for federal tax exempt status under section ==501(c)(3)== so that it could receive deductible donations from interested users.  This ruling is still pending in the IRS.  Beginning in 2012, Mushroom Observer member John Harper, a tax lawyer with Morrison & Foerster, noticed that CDMR’s exemption application had been pending with the IRS for an unusually long time, and volunteered to help CDMR on a pro-bono basis in its attempt to attempt to obtain recognition of a section ==501(c)(3)== status for CDMR.  Since then he has briefed the IRS on the issues that the IRS has raised, and had a conference with the IRS to discuss the ruling request.  CDMR’s case is currently under review in the National Office of the IRS.\n\nIn light of CDMR’s unsettled tax status, CDMR’s board decided not to solicit donations at the end of last year.  However, the CDMR board of directors is committed to creating or joining a recognized tax-exempt non-profit that can receive deductible donations to support online mycological resources such as the Mushroom Observer.  Exactly what form this will take and how soon it will happen is still up in the air.\n\nWithout financial support from CDMR, I have been personally paying to support Mushroom Observer largely out of my own pocket over the last few months. I would very much appreciate any <a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=2TGUG7TNXYF7Q\">personal gifts</a> that you all would be willing to send to contribute to the cost of keeping Mushroom Observer online during this interim period. This will be especially important before we can attempt to improve the level of performance by adding more servers. Any gifts I receive will be used to cover costs directly associated with running the Mushroom Observer and such donations will continue to be recognized on the Mushroom Observer donors page. Unfortunately, you will not be able to count them as tax deductible donations.  You can make your gifts with a credit card through <a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=2TGUG7TNXYF7Q\">PayPal</a> or you can send your checks to:\n\nNathan Wilson\n68 Bay Rd.\nNorth Falmouth, MA 02556\n\n\nThanks for all your contributions to the Mushroom Observer,\n-Nathan"

  intro_title: Introduction
  intro_purpose: "*Purpose&#58;* The purpose of this site is to record observations about mushrooms, help people identify mushrooms they aren't familiar with, and expand the community around the scientific exploration of mushrooms (mycology).  Some have asked what counts as a mushroom.  This site takes a very broad view.  While the emphasis is on the large fleshy fungi, other fungi such as lichens, rust and molds as well as fungus-like organisms such as slime-molds are all welcome.  Ultimately, I hope this site will become a valuable resource for both amateur and professional mycologists.  I like to think of it as a living field guide for mushrooms or a collaborative mushroom field journal.\n\nFor those new to mycology, there is a huge amount of basic research that still needs to be done.  By some estimates less than 5% of the world's species of fungi are known to science.  While things are slightly better for the large fleshy fungi known as mushrooms, it is still a common experience to come across a mushroom that cannot be easily identified in the available books or which doesn't really fit the definition of any recognized species. This site is intended to address that gap by creating a place for us to talk about and record what we've found, as well as connect to the existing literature about mushrooms.  Please do not feel intimidated by the scientific bent of the site.  Everyone is welcome to dive in and add their own mushroom observations, upload mushroom photos and make [:comments] on other people's observations."
  intro_image_sharing: "*Image Sharing:* This site follows the principles of cooperative sharing pioneered by the \"Free Software Foundation\":http://fsf.org, further expressed by the \"Open Source software movement\":http://opensource.org, and expanded to other creative efforts by the \"Creative Commons\":http://creativecommons.org. Consequently all images are made available under one of the Creative Commons licenses or are in the public domain.  In short this means that when anyone uploads one of their images to the site, they are giving others explicit permission to use those images under certain \"conditions\":/observer/how_to_use#license in perpetuity.  This type of permission is very important for basic research.  It allows future researchers to freely use these data to expand our understanding of mushrooms.  It also significantly increases the likelihood that the data will continue to be available into the distant future.\n\nIf you upload your own images, this license does not mean you are giving up your copyright or your ability to make money off your images.  Depending on which license you choose, you can still require that anyone who wishes to use any of these images for commercial purposes get in touch with the copyright holder and work out the conditions for that use.  The site includes special links on the image pages to help create those relationships."
  intro_source_code: "*Source Code:* Source code for the site is available at: \"[repo]\":[repo] and is licensed under the \"Open Source MIT License\":http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php.  Source code contributions are welcome (\"README\":[readme]). Here's a list of \"planned features\":[todo_list]. All suggestions and comments are welcome.  If you would like to contribute, please send mail to *nathan at collectivesource.com* so we can coordinate our efforts."
  intro_governance: "*Governance:* This site is owned and operated by \"Mushroom Observer, Inc.\":/support/governance."
  intro_note: "*Note:* The administrators of this site reserve the right to remove any material they deem inappropriate or not in keeping with the purpose of this site."

  how_help_business_planning: "h4. 6. Business Planning\n\np(normal).  So far [:app_title] has been an entirely volunteer effort, after some time consuming false starts, we are now in the process of creating a new non-profit focused solely on Mushroom Observer. This is just getting going so let us know if you want to get involved or have any business related advice."

  # observer/how_to_use
  how_title: How to Use [:app_title]
  how_common_tasks: Common Tasks
  how_glossary: Concepts Glossary
  how_intro: This page provides some short descriptions of common uses of this website followed by an overview of the basic concepts used.
  how_keeping_up: "*Keeping Up with Changes* - The default page for [:app_title] is the '[:rss_log_title]', it is also accessible through the '\"Latest Changes\":/' link in the left-hand panel.  This page shows you the most recent changes on the site.  It lists new \"Observations\":#observation and \"Species Lists\":#species_list as well as significant changes to any already existing ones.  Additions of \"Images\":#image and \"Comments\":#comment are considered significant changes to the relevant observations.  Changes to \"Names\":#name are also listed.  Click the page numbers at the top and bottom of the page to browse through older changes.  Observations and names created as a side effect of other changes are not listed separately.\n\nNote : The latest changes can be tracked using our \"RSS feed\":/observer/rss. See this \"wikipedia article\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rss for more information about RSS feeds."
  how_searching: "*Searching* - There are several interesting ways to search for information on the site.  The simplest is to type a search string into the search box near the top of each page and click one of the buttons next to it.  This will give you a list of all the \"Observations\":#observation, \"Images\":#image, \"Names\":#name or \"Locations\":#location that contain fields matching the given string.  If you need a little more control over the search, try clicking '[:app_advanced_search]'.\n\nYou may also browse the site using the links in the left-hand panel.  For example, '[:app_index_a_z]' shows all the species that have observations, listed alphabetically.  You can page through this list, or skip directly to the letter of a name you are interested in by clicking the appropriate page number or letter along the top or bottom of the list.  Click a name from this list to see a description of the species and a list of observations of that species.  If you click a genus like 'Agaricus', it will also show a list of species in that genus.  Note, however, that in this case it will only show observations that have been identified to the genus level, not ones that have been identified as a species in that genus.  On the other hand, if two names are considered synonyms, you will see observations for either name on this page.  (*NOTE*: If you do a search on 'Agaricus', it _will_ show all the observations whose name contains that string, so you get all the observations that belong to that genus.)\n\nWhenever you click an observation or other result on an index page, it will take you to a page showing that result.  At the top of the page you will see '[:PREV]', '[:NEXT]', and '[:INDEX]' links.  These let you browse forward or backward through the results or return to the index.  At the top of the index page you will often see links allowing you to sort the results by different criteria, such as by date, name or user.  In the same place you will sometimes find links that let you turn an index of observations into an index of names or images of those same observations.  For example, if you click '[:app_your_observations]', it will show you a list of observations you have posted.  Click '[:show_objects(types=:names)]' at the top of the page to see a list of the species you have seen, or click '[:show_objects(types=:locations)]' to see a list of all the locations you've gone mushrooming in.\n\nPower users may also be interested in our new API providing direct access to our database back-end.  This can be used to mine our database for images or species descriptions for inclusion in wikipedia or other public websites. You can also use it to upload observations and images and much more.  Please contact the webmaster for more information."
  how_unknown_help: "*Getting Help with an Unknown* - In order to get help with an unknown, you need to have a user account.  These can be created easily by selecting '[:app_create_account]' from the left-hand panel.  See the discussion of \"Users\":#user below for more details.\n\nOnce you are logged in, create a new \"Observation\":#observation by selecting '[:app_create_observation]' in the left-hand panel.  Enter all the details you can into the resulting form.  You can leave the '[:WHAT]' field blank call it '[:unknown]', or if you think you know the genus or family or other group, give that \"Name\":#name followed by 'sp.', e.g., 'Russula sp.'. In the '[:NOTES]' field provide information about habitat, odor, smell and anything else not clear from the photos.  Once the form is as complete as you can make it, click '[:CREATE]'.\n\nYou should now be looking at a page showing you the information you just entered.  However, if you used a name that is not currently in the database, you will be asked if you want to add the name.  This also gives you a chance to catch and fix typos.  In addition, if you use a name that is considered deprecated, you will be given the option of using a preferred synonym.\n\nOnce you have created the new observation, you can upload any \"Images\":#image you have by selecting the '[:show_observation_add_images]' link on the right-side of the page.  It is very important either that it be an image you took or that you have the explicit permission of the person who created the image to upload it to the site.  If you did not take the image, please update the '[:form_images_copyright_holder]' field to reflect the actual owner.  This page also allows you to select the \"License\":#license you want to release the image under.\n\nWhen you add unknowns, the community will generally \"propose one or more names\":#proposing_names for it within 24-hours.  If you find any of the suggested names compelling, you should not hesitate to revisit your observation and \"Vote\":#vote on them.  Please see the discussion below on \"voting\":#voting, as well.  Members of the community may also post feedback via \"Comments\":#comment.  By default your account is set up to deliver comments posted about your observations to you by email.  If you are asked to provide more details on the collection, we prefer that you select '[:show_observation_edit_observation]' (at the top of the observation page) and add them to the '[:NOTES]' field than to just post another comment."
  how_adding_observations: "*Adding Observations You Have Identified* - Use the same process as \"Getting Help with an Unknown\":#unknown_help, except this time provide your identification in the '[:WHAT]' field.  You are strongly encouraged to say something about how you arrived at the identification.  We've provided a small set of checkboxes to make this easy ('[:naming_reason_label_1]', '[:naming_reason_label_3]', etc.), but you are encouraged to elaborate on them in the provided text fields (e.g., list the references you used, or enter 'sequenced the DNA and compared it against the data in GenBank'!). Community members will often post \"Comments\":#comment if there is some question about the collection or if they would like clarification as to why you ruled out other \"Names\":#name.  Roy Halling has provided beautifully illustrated presentations describing <a href=\"http://mushroomobserver.org/pdf/macro-features.pdf\">macroscopic</a> and <a href=\"http://mushroomobserver.org/pdf/micro-features.pdf\">microscopic</a> features. More documentation on creating scientifically valuable collections is available from the <a href=\"http://mycoportal.org/portal/misc/links.php\">MycoPortal Links Page</a>."
  how_proposing_names: "*Proposing Names* - Any member of the community can propose \"Names\":#name for any \"Observations\":#observation.  Click an observation (e.g., from the '[:rss_log_title]' page) and scroll down below the observation notes.  There should be a list of \"Proposed Names\":#proposed_name enclosed in a thin outlined box.  Most observations will already have at least one proposed name (by the owner).  From here you may either click '[:show_namings_propose_new_name]' or \"Vote\":#voting on existing names.  In either case you will have to log in before you are allowed to do so.\n\nWhen you click '[:show_namings_propose_new_name]' you will be presented with a form much like the one used to create an observation.  In addition to the name, you are required to choose a confidence level.  This is your \"Vote\":#vote, and you may change it on the '[:show_object(type=:observation)]' page at any time you like.  As with creating an observation, you are strongly encouraged to give some explanation as to why you think your Name applies to this Observation (and why other names don't).  When you are finished, click '[:CREATE]'.  You will be given a chance to correct typos or to choose an accepted name if you entered a deprecated one.\n\nUsers are not allowed to propose a name if someone else has already done so. The only reason to do so would be to describe alternative reasons for reaching the same conclusion.  Instead use the discussion forum provided by comments to do this."
  how_voting: "*Voting on Proposed Names* - Click an \"Observation\":#observation, e.g., from the '[:rss_log_title]' page, and scroll down to the '[:show_namings_proposed_names]' box.  Note that you must login before you can see or change any of your \"Votes\":#vote.  Once you have logged in, you should see pulldown menus next to each \"Proposed Name\":#proposed_name.  Your vote expresses the degree of confidence or agreement you have with placing that name on that observation.  Everything above '[min_neg_vote]' is considered a positive vote, everything below '[min_pos_vote]' negative. Choose '[no_opinion]' to tell it to delete your vote.  When you've changed all the votes you want to, be sure to click '[:show_namings_update_votes]' to record your votes.  Don't worry, if you forget and try to navigate away without casting your votes it will complain (unless you have Javascript disabled).\n\nRoughly speaking, votes for a name are weighted, summed and then divided by the number of votes for that name.  The name with the highest score wins, and that name will be applied to that observation throughout the site.  In the case where multiple synonyms are proposed for an observation it lumps the votes together, choosing each user's strongest vote within that group of synonyms.  In the end, assuming that group of synonyms wins, the currently accepted name is used as the community consensus.  If there is still debate in the scientific community about which name is appropriate for a given taxon, then it will use votes the best it can to decide between multiple accepted names.  Note that the owner's vote automatically carries a little more weight, as do the votes of users who have made a large \"Contribution\":#contribution to [:app_title] or who are considered experts.  Click '[:app_contributors]' or click a user's name to see the contribution and expert status.  (We use the log base 10 of users' contributions.)"
  how_adding_comments: "*Adding Comments* - When you are looking at an \"Observation\":#observation, if you would like to post or respond to a \"Comment\":#comment, select the '[:show_comments_add_comment]' link near the top of the page.  If you are not currently logged in to a \"User\":#user account, you will be asked to log in.  Once you are logged in, you will be given a form asking for a summary and your comment.  Note that you can do some simple formatting in the comment section.  This is briefly documented below the text field with a link to detailed documentation.  You can also add links within a comment using standard HTML formatting.  The HTML gets automatically cleaned to avoid security problems like script injection, so try not to get too fancy."
  how_tracking_species: "*Tracking a Particular Species or Genus Through Email* - [:app_title] allows you to request an email any time a particular \"Name\":#name is given to an \"Observation\":#observation.  If that name is a genus or species it will also send you an email whenever a species or subspecies is observed.  To turn this feature on, go to the page for a Name you are interested in (see \"Searching\":#searching) and click '[:show_name_email_tracking]'.  You can configure it so that the person who made the observation that was given that name will be sent a customized email to let them know you are interested in their observation.  If you don't provide any instructions, they will not be sent an email.  If the observer gives the name at the time the observation is created, they will be shown your message immediately through the website. You can modify or disable your request for a particular name by going back to that name and again selecting '[:show_name_email_tracking]' and clicking the '[:DISABLE]' button on the page that comes up."
  how_describing_species: "*Describing Species* - Click any \"Name\":#name link you see throughout the site.  For example, click any of the results listed in \"[:app_index_a_z]\":/name/observation_index, search for a name in the search bar, or click the 'About &lt;&#110;ame&gt;...' link at the top of any \"Observation\":#observation page.  These all take you to a page summarizing everything we know about this taxon.  If you are familiar with this species and there is something you would like to add, click '[:show_name_edit_name]' and add your notes.  You are encouraged to cite references including field guides and scientific papers.  Short quotes from references are fine, but please don't make extensive quotes without obtaining permission from the original author."
  how_projects: "*Projects* - Projects are a way for a group of \"Users\":#user to work together to create a set of work that they want to keep out of the public eye until they are ready to publish it.  The original purpose was to support university classes where there was a desire to keep a more controlled environment while the class was going.\n\nAnyone can create a new project by clicking on '\"[:app_list_projects]\":/project/list_projects' in the left-hand panel and then clicking on '[:list_projects_add_project]'.  The person who creates the project is always a member and an administrator for that project.  An administrator for a project can add new members by clicking the '[:show_project_add_members]' link at the top of a project's 'Show Project' page.  Administrators can also make other users administrators for the project by going to one of the '[:add_members_change_status]' links available on the 'Show Project' or 'Add Members' pages.  Any User can send requests to the admins for a project.  These requests are emailed to the admins and contain a link for changing that user's status.\n\nCurrently the primary focus of projects is writing \"Descriptions\":#description for various species.  Note, however, that anyone can now create new descriptions for a species (see \"Describing Species\":#describing_species) by clicking on '[:show_name_create_description]' at the top of the 'Show Name' page. Descriptions that are created for a project are visible only to members of that project until they are published, and editable only by the owner of the description and project administrators.  When a description is published it will become the official description if no official description exists yet."
  how_maps: "*Working with Maps* - Currently there are three types of maps available on [:app_title]: Occurrence Maps (e.g., \"Occurrence map for **__Craterellus cornucopioides__**\":/name/map/284), Location Maps (e.g., \"Salt Point State Park\":/location/show_location/4) and the \"[:map_locations_global_map]\":/location/map_locations.\n\nTo see an occurrence map for a particular \"Name\":#name, go to the page for that name (e.g., enter the name in the search bar, select '[:NAMES]'), and click '[:app_search]', then click '[:show_name_distribution_map]' at the top of the page.\n\nUsers are encouraged to add to the occurrence map for a name.  The easiest way is to create a new \"Observation\":#observation using an already defined \"Location\":#location.  Note, however, that auto-completion for the '[:WHERE]' field will list all matching locations whether they are defined or not.\n\nYou can also explicitly choose not to have an observation show up on the occurrence map.  This allows you to record observations of mushrooms in places like mushroom fairs, old photos or other places where you may not know where the mushroom was actually collected.  When creating or editing an observation there is a checkbox labeled '[:form_observations_is_collection_location]'.  By default it is checked.  If you uncheck it, that observation will not appear in any occurrence maps."
  how_defining_locations: "*Defining Undefined Locations* - Many \"Observations\":#observation have been reported from undefined \"Locations\":#location.  These observations will not appear in our \"occurrence maps\":#maps.  An excellent, easy way for \"Users\":#user to help out if they have a little spare time is to locate and define these undefined locations.\n\nWhen browsing through observations, defined location names will be followed by a link labeled '[:click_for_map]'.  Undefined location names will be followed by a link labeled '[:SEARCH]'.  If you click the link for an undefined location, it will show a list of observations reported for that location.  The resulting page will include two links at the top of the page: '[:list_observations_location_define]' and '[:list_observations_location_merge]'.  Clicking on '[:list_observations_location_define]' will present a form which you can use to create that location.  Clicking on 'Merge With a Defined Location' will present you with a list of similar locations which have already been defined.  Clicking on any of these locations will perform the merge.\n\nYou can also see a list of all locations in use by clicking on '\"[:app_list_locations]\":/location/list_locations' in the left-hand panel. This page lists both the defined locations (first column, sorted alphabetically) and the undefined locations (second column, sorted by the number of observations reported from that location).  In some cases the same location has been given multiple names (e.g., 'Point Reyes National Seashore' and 'Pt Reyes Park').  You can merge an undefined location with a defined location by clicking on '[:list_place_names_merge]' next to the undefined location (see above).\n\nWhen defining a new location, the first thing to do is to review its name. Mushroom Observer tries to enforce a set of \"rules\":/location/help.\n\nIn theory it is possible for the same location to be defined more than once (presumably by different users).  If this happens, you can request a merge by editing one of the two locations and changing its name to be exactly the same as the other's.  This will not have any immediate effect, but it will display a warning message, and an email will be sent to the site administrators with the details.  Merging defined locations is restricted since it can cause significant data loss."
  how_creating_species_lists: "*Creating Species Lists* - To create a \"Species List\":#species_list, click '\"[:app_create_list]\":/species_list/create_species_list' in the left-hand panel.  Fill out the various fields.  In the 'Write-In Species' field, you should give each species a \"Name\":#name on a line by itself.  When you go to create the list, each line is checked to see if there is a match in the database.  If there is no matching name, you will be asked if you want to add the unknown names to the database.  This gives you a chance to catch and fix typos as well as giving you a simple way to add missing names.  Each name given in the 'Write-In Species' field (or loaded from a file) will be used to create a completely new \"Observation\":#observation.  The '[:form_species_lists_list_notes]' are only shown when the entire species list is shown.  Use '[:form_species_lists_member_notes]' to indicate text you would like to add to each new observation.\n\nThere are several methods of collecting a set of existing observations into a new list.  In the simplest method, first create an empty species list, then go to each of the observations you want to add and select '[:show_observation_manage_species_lists]'.  This will give you the opportunity to add that observation to any species list you own.  (Note, you can add anyone's observations to a species list you own.)\n\nIn another method, you may select '[:app_create_list]' directly from any index of observations or names.  For example, you may use the search bar at the top of the page or the '\"[:app_advanced_search]\":/observer/advanced_search_form' feature to request all observations from Michigan.  When it shows you the first page of results, click '[:app_create_list]' (in the left-hand panel), and it will give you a list of all the matching names to choose from in the new species list form.\n\nLastly, when you are viewing an existing species list, you may click '[:species_list_show_clone_list]' or '[:species_list_show_set_source]' at the top of the page.  '[:species_list_show_clone_list]' will take you directly to a new species list form, with all the information of the existing list already filled in.  '[:species_list_show_set_source]' will copy that species list's names to the clipboard.  The next time you click '[:app_create_list]', the new species list form will give you this list of names to choose from (unless you show another observation or name index in the meantime)."

A comment may only be edited or deleted by the owner or a site administrator.  You can look up all comments that have been made about your observations by clicking on '\"[:show_user_comments_for_you]\":/comment/show_comments_for_user' in the left-hand panel."
  how_contribution: "*Contribution* - A number or score that measures the quantity and quality of contributions a \"User\":#user has made to [:app_title].  Click '[:app_your_summary]' to see a break-down of your own contribution.  You earn points for every \"Observation\":#observation, \"Image\":#image, \"Comment\":#comment, etc. you have posted.  \"Describing Species\":#describing_species and \"Defining Locations\":defining_locations are some of the most important contributions a user can make.  (See \"How To Help\":/observer/how_to_help for a list of other ways to help out.) Currently, contribution is used only in weighting your \"Votes\":#vote when voting on \"Proposed Names\":#proposed_names for observations."
  how_description: "*Species Description* - A collection of text describing a \"Name\":#name. Every name automatically gets one official description that everyone in the community is allowed to read and modify.  Additional descriptions may be created by any \"User\":#user, including project members.  The owner of a description may choose any level of read or write permissions, and can control who is given authorship credit.  Since descriptions, especially the official one, are often collaborative efforts, modifications by a user are subject to community review, and past versions are kept to facilitate this process.  The content of a description includes a set list of sections, including things like '[:form_names_gen_desc]', '[:form_names_diag_desc]', '[:form_names_look_alikes]', '[:form_names_refs]' and other notes."
  how_image: "*Image* - A photograph or illustration of one or more mushroom species. Images are associated with one or more \"Observations\":#observation.  A given Image is owned by a particular \"User\":#user who may or may not be the copyright holder.  Only the owner or a site administrator can remove an image or edit the associated information.  All images in the site are required to be released under one of the \"Creative Commons licenses\":http://creativecommons.org or in the public domain.  If you dispute the given copyright or the licensing of an image you are the copyright holder of, send mail to the \"webmaster\":/observer/ask_webmaster_question."
  how_license: "*License* - \"Images\":#image on [:app_title] are posted with an explicit license.  The current options are the \"Creative Commons Attribution, Share Alike License\":http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/, the \"Creative Commons Attribution, Non-Commercial, Share Alike License\":http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/ and \"Public Domain\":http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Public_domain/.  The primary difference is whether the image can be used in any potentially commercial setting.  One of the side effects of selecting the non-commercial license is that your image cannot be used on \"Wikipedia\":http://wikipedia.org.  The license can be set on a per image basis.  The looser, Wikipedia compatible license is the default for new \"Users\":#user.  However, you can select the non-commercial license to be your default by selecting it on your '\"[:app_preferences]\":/account/prefs' page and clicking on '[:SAVE_CHANGES]'.  Public domain is supported primarily for images that are already in the public domain or for images from certain government institutions that cannot claim ownership of works"
  how_location: "*Location* - A rectangular region enclosing a given location, as defined by the northern, southern, eastern and western boundaries.  In addition to the position, locations can also include a minimum and maximum elevation along with various notes.  Note that the elevations should be in meters not feet. A location is not considered to be owned by a particular \"User\":#user.  Any user may change or define any location, but all of a user's changes are subject to review by the community.  To help with this review process, copies of the previous versions are kept."
  how_name: "*Name* - A name for some group of mushrooms.  Most commonly this is the name of a species, but it can be any taxon (genus, family, variety, etc.).  Names can also refer to groups that are not officially recognized scientific names such as common names or functional groups like Gasteromyces.  A name is *not* considered to be owned by a particular \"User\":#user.  Any user may change any name, but all changes are subject to review by the community.  To help with this review process, copies of previous versions are kept.  Names can have an acknowledged author.  The author is normally only given for scientific names. The author should follow the standard practice of listing the person who first correctly published the name.  In the case of names at or below the species level, the author may also include the person who transfered the species to the current genus, e.g., (Singer) Jenkins."
  how_observation: "*Observation* - A record of a single mushroom species at a particular time and \"Location\":#location.  Typically associated with one or more \"Names\":#name (see \"Proposed Name\":#proposed_name below) and some number of \"Images\":#image.  Each observation is owned by a \"User\":#user, and can only be edited or deleted by that user or a site administrator.  However, any user may post \"Comments\":#comment about any observation.  Observations can also be included in one or more \"Species Lists:#species_list."
  how_proposed_name: "*Proposed Name* - A \"Name\":#name as proposed for a given \"Observation\":#observation.  Any number of names may be proposed for a single observation by members of the community.  No special treatment is given to any member's name.  Community consensus is arrived at through the process of \"voting\":#voting.  Each proposed name for an observation is owned by a single \"User\":#user.  However, even the user who proposed the name cannot necessarily modify or delete a name once other members of the community have cast \"Votes\":#vote for or against it.  Fortunately you may always propose additional names.  There is never any sort of penalty associated with proposing incorrect names."
  how_species_list: "*Species List* - A list of \"Observations\":#observation (not \"Names\":#name). Includes a date, a \"Location\":#location and a title for the list.  A given species list is owned by a particular \"User\":#user.  Only the owner or a site administrator can change or delete a species list.  There are no strict rules for how species lists should be used.  This is an area that is likely to change in the future as the community comes up with clearer ideas for how they should be used."
  how_user: "*User* - An account on [:app_title].  You are required to provide a valid email address when you first create an account.  This allows the system to stop automated programs from creating bogus accounts.  It also provides a way for other users to get in touch with you.  However, your email address will never be revealed unless you request an email be sent to another user and then only to that user.  If you are concerned about having your email address in our database, once you have verified your account, you can go to the '\"[:app_preferences]\":/account/prefs' page and remove your address."
  how_vote: "*Vote* - One \"User's\":#user vote on a \"Proposed Name\":#proposed_name for a given \"Observation\":#observation.  Expresses a level of confidence or agreement with that name, with half the choices (\"[min_pos_vote]\" and up) being positive and half (\"[min_neg_vote]\" and below) being negative.  Votes are owned by that user, and can only be changed or deleted by the owner or a site administrator."

  # Location help
  location_help_title: Locations in Mushroom Observer
  location_help_intro: "The Mushroom Observer provides two ways to represent the geographic location of an observation.  The simplest are latitude and longitude positions associated with the observation.  Please keep these accurate to within at least 300 meters (or about 1000 feet).  However, the more widely used method is a simple phrase describing the location.  For example, \"Beebe Woods, Falmouth, Massachusetts, USA\". The goal of these location names is to provide a consistent, reusable way of talking about where an observation was made without necessarily revealing a precise \"spot\". If you are comfortable provide more precise lat/longs for an observation, the location names are still useful for searches so you are encouraged to provide them as well.  The location names should, by default, go from the smallest contained area to the country name.  If you prefer to describe your locations as going from the largest (country) down to the smallest contained area, you can change your preference from the default, \"Postal\", to \"Scientific\" on your preference page.  There are cases such as \"Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Blount Co., Tennessee, USA\", where the area you are describing overlaps a number of counties, states or even countries.  In these cases, the country and other official political boundaries should come at the end as shown in the example.\n\nOriginally, the Mushroom Observer was very loose about these location names, hoping that the users would create a reasonably consistent set of rules and correct each other.  After about four years and thousands of location names, we found that there were rules emerging, but they were not applied at all consistently and people were not tending to directly correct each other. Consequently, we have tried to codify these rules and when reasonable to provide warnings if you attempt to create a new location that violates these rules. It is not always possible to correct identify \"bad\" locations, so if you get some warnings, but after reviewing the location decide it should be \"good\", then simply resubmitting the form will force the name into the database. However, all new location names will get reviewed regularly and may get changed to better fit the consensus rules.  Below are some examples of \"bad\" and \"good\" location names followed by a more detailed explanation of the current rules. Each example is labeled with the following section that explains the example in more detail.  These rules are by no means set it stone and we encourage the discussion and revision of them."
  location_help_example_help: These are cases that are not detected automatically, so no warning would be given.
  location_help_example_title: Some examples
  location_help_bad: Bad
  location_help_good: Good
  location_help_explanation: Explanation
  location_help_rules_title: The Current "Rules"
  location_help_rule_reversible: "*Consistent and Reversible Order* - You can now ask for location names to appear in the reverse order from the default. Thus, you can see a location as either:\n\nAlbion, California, USA\n\nor as\n\nUSA, California, Albion\n\nYou can change this on your Preferences page by selecting 'Postal' (the default) or 'Scientific' (the one that starts with the country).  When you input new location names it will of course also follow your preferred order.\n\nRoy Halling was the inspiration for this feature when he started putting in his locations starting with the country names and we got into a discussion about it. Apparently the standard practice in the scientific community is to start with the largest locale (typically a country) and work down to the smallest locale (a county, town or specific location).  From looking through all the locations that have been put into MO, it is clear that most people expect to put in the smallest location first and work up to the country.\n\nIn order to enable this feature, I have had to require that the place names be easily and consistently reversible.  This means you must separate each section of the location with a ', ' (no period, no missing spaces, no double spaces). It also means that you should always enter the names in order of increasing size when you can.  There are some specific exceptions to this rule that are discussed below."
  location_help_rule_countries: "*Use Country Names* - As a further check when you enter an unfamiliar location, it will check to see that the largest locale has been previously entered for some other location.  This list currently consists of only countries, continents and the special location 'Unknown'. Since it does not include all possible countries, it is still possible to override the check by resubmitting the same name twice.  Such entries will be reviewed carefully to ensure that this list remains clean.  For now you should only enter country names as they are written in English.  For example, please use 'Germany' rather than 'Deutschland'.  The goal for the moment is simply consistency.  However, the long term goal is to actually allow these names to be consistently translated based on the user's language selection.  Continents should only be used if the country is not known or there is no country."
  location_help_rule_states: "*Use State Names* - In the case of countries where I know the states, I also check for those as the next smallest area within a country.  At the moment I am checking this for Canada, Australia and USA.  The primary goal of this in the US at least is to ensure the uniqueness of the next element in the list.  In the US it is not unusual to have the same city or county name in more than one state. If there are other countries where this check would be useful, please let me know and include an exhaustive list of all states, provinces, territories etc. To increase the understandability to people from other parts of the world, state abbreviations (even extremely standard ones) are discouraged and will create a warning.  The one current exception is 'Washington DC'.  Many people are not aware of what the 'DC' stands for and would be unlikely to enter 'Washington, District of Columbia'.  Note that in this case I have also removed the ', ' since that would cause 'USA, DC, Washington' when in 'Scientific' mode."
  location_help_rule_counties: "*Counties OR Cities* - In the past, MO has encouraged the use of county names whenever they are known.  The new policy is that the county should only be included when it is the smallest political area the location is contained in or when the city or town name is ambiguous.  For example, what used to be described as \"Berkeley, Alameda Co., California, USA\" should now be given as just \"Berkeley, California, USA\".  This change is in part due to seeing what people actually do.  Generally people have been good about using county names in the case of public lands like parks and national forests where the county is the most obvious political boundary.  However, with cities and towns people often don't know what county a city or town is in.  In addition, the information is typically redundant for towns and cities in the US where they are almost always completely contained in county or they are independent of the counties and there are almost never two towns with same names in a state (there are exceptions though such as Goshen, Vermont). I've also found that many of the map services such as maps.google.com and maps.yahoo.com get confused if you include both the city and the county in the search string.\n\nThat being said, there are also often areas that have a local name, but are not actually an incorporated city or town.  In these cases the county name is encouraged since the names cannot be assumed to be unique.  For example, \"North Lakeport, Lake Co., California, USA\".  Wikipedia has been the most helpful resource I've found for determining if a town is actually incorporated."
  location_help_rule_near: "*Use 'near'* - If there is a landmark or town near to the collection location, but the smallest political boundary is a county or country, then it is helpful to mention this using the word \"near\".  When used this way it should always be all lowercase.  For example, \"Albis Mountain Range, near Zurich, Switzerland\".  Looking through the old data, I found users used both \"near\" and \"area\" for this with \"near\" being more common.  This is also better because \"area\" sometimes gets used for place names such as \"Day-Use Area\" or \"Rest Area\"."
  location_help_rule_southern: "*Use of 'Southern', 'Northern' etc.* - If there isn't a known a clear landmark or town near the collection location, it is fine to use compass directions such as 'Southern', 'Northern', 'Southwestern' etc.  In these cases always use the '-ern' ending to indicate that it's descriptive.  However, these terms should be avoided if it creates ambiguity.  For example, \"Western Australia\" is the name of an official state in Australia, so it should only be used as such and should be followed by the country name."
  location_help_rule_abbr: "*Avoid Abbreviations (and Periods in General)* - Most abbreviations should be avoided since people apply them somewhat arbitrarily and inconsistently.  The following are examples of abbreviations that should definitely be avoided: Hwy, Mt, Mtn, CA, BC.  However, there are some specific examples, that should be used in preference to there spelled out versions.  These are:\n\nCo. for County\nRd. for Road\nSt. for Street\nAve. for Avenue\nBlvd. for Boulevard\nUSA for United States of America\nWashington DC for Washington, District of Columbia\n\n\nPeriods in general should be avoided except for the above abbreviations. They should not be used at the end of country names or as separators.\nFinally, 'and' should be used rather than '&'."
  location_help_rule_other: "*Other Things to Avoid* - All lowercase - In general at least the leading letter of each area should be capitalized and when in doubt capitalize every leading letter.\nNo lat/longs - There is now direct support for this for each observation. Do not include it in the name of a location.\nNo habitat info - Habitat info should go in the notes for the observation.\nParentheses and Braces - If you're tempted to use parentheses or braces, stop yourself and ask if this information should be in the notes for the observation or if there is a better way to describe the location.\nAvoid diacritics (eg é, ü etc.) - As mentioned when discussing country names, you should try to use the English version of a location name when possible and English does not include diacritics.  This is intended to encourage consistency and we are planning on providing proper support for other languages which will benefit from this consistency.  There are certainly cases where the a city or region is only know by a name that includes diacritics.  In these cases they should be used. A few simple web-searches should give you a good idea if there is a common English variation of a name (e.g., Montreal, Quebec for Montréal, Québec)."
  location_help_rule_good_habits: "*Stuff You Are Encouraged to Do* - If you are creating a new name, take some time to figure out a good name. Searching within Mushroom Observer can be helpful.  If you don't find anything there, then look things up in Google Maps (http://maps.google.com) and Wikipedia (http://wikipedia.org). Also feel free to use the notes section of either an observation or a location to be more specific."
